Also co-op, and the ability to actually control large scale battles or just actual large scale battles. Most importantly, better combat, weapon fighting gets incredibly boring after a while, maybe make it more realistic, like having to go for weak spots and such on heavily armored guys. And more and different types of weapons and horseback combat. Oh yeah and make it really clear if an NPC is in any way involved with a quest even misc. quests, you can still be able to kill them, but no killing quest related people by accident.

You should also be able to design houses the way you want them, and maybe set up a shop or something in town that you have to manage, or maybe a farm you have to visit every now and then, maybe a family and wife or something. But you'd have to get to a certain point in the game and be able to choose your wife and such. That might be a bit sim like but at least having relationships would be nice.

I don't mind leveling by training skills; in fact, I think it's part of the Elder Scrolls gaming experince. But this variable bonus leveling could disappear from the series, really. Perhaps they could fix the bonus marks (say, +5/+3/+1) and allow you to give the highest mark only to attributes whose related skills you've leveled up the most during the previous level, I don't know.

It does allow people to do better at lockpicking by being better at the minigame, but they can also pick any lock straight out of prison if they are good enough. For a non-RPG game this is fine, but the game is based on leveling up a character to allow you to do more and better things, not increasing your own skill at something in the game.

This is why I felt that Fallout 3 had a better lockpicking minigame than Oblivion. While it was annoying to not be able to pick certain locks, this limited your character to what was within their own skill set.

&gt;  Description book **Fixed on You by Laurelin Paige**:

&gt;  Stalking and restraining orders are a thing of Alayna Wither’s past. With her MBA newly in hand, she has her future figured out — move up at the nightclub she works at and stay away from any guy who might trigger her obsessive love disorder. A perfect plan.But what Alayna didn’t figure on is Hudson Pierce, the new owner of the nightclub. He’s smart, rich, and gorgeous — the kind of guy Alayna knows to stay away from if she wants to keep her past tendencies in check. Except, Hudson’s fixed his sights on her. He wants her in his bed and makes no secret of it.Avoiding him isn’t an option after he offers a business proposition she can’t turn down and she’s drawn further into his universe, unable to resist his gravitational pull. When she learns Hudson has a dark history of his own, she realizes too late that she’s fallen for the worst man she could possibly get involved with. Or maybe their less than ideal pasts give them an opportunity to heal each other and finally find the love their lives have been missing.

To make it easier, start gta iv before modding, save a car(preferably a SUV), memorize the car name. Then when you install the car mod you'll know what car to replace and once you start the game your downloadable car will be there.  


Happy gaming, but on a side note GTA IV is a pain in the arse to mod, I've tried many times and just plain rage quit it since it crashes for this reason or the other. You should look into how to downgrade your copy to the 1.040 version as its less glitchy on mods and for me its kinda faster in performance. But no online play if you downgrade.

There are many things in Odyssey that could be changed such as the anatomically correct people. I believe these may have been placed by Nintendo to form some kind of meme that would help to market the game.

Also, for the people here who say it's ""final,"" I would hope Nintendo would spend the whole year until its release still working on it. As Miyamoto said, ""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.""

This makes it seem like the airship is an objective to get to when you first start in the city. The airship does not have the beacon in any other shots, proving that it stops being the objective once you've reached it for presumably the first time in the city.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,,,,LustForLife,,,,,,,,t2_3vigx,,,"I get it all the time, especially in the times where I try to snipe. This isn't my clip, but it still shows how fucking shoddy the hit detection in this game is at times: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1BLDxELL2U. I highly doubt that's from theatre mode either since Predator records gameplay all the time for montages. MW2 and CoD4 had it, but for me it was rare, in this game it is consistent to the point where it ruins the experience.

RC-Cars are never going to go down in usage, I guarantee it. A potential 2 kill killstreak that is essentially a guaranteed kill will always be used by worse players because of how effective it is and how easy it is to get.

I honestly hope you're right, but again, I will remain skeptical. The past CoDs have always had some cheap crutch to help players eek out a few cheap kills (Martyrdom, 3X Frags, OMA GLs, Painkiller, etc.), I honestly don't see how it will be used even less when the other perks just aren't that useful for the average player. Most don't care if they get killed by a claymore/are exposed to a motion sensor because they barely move around the map if any, making Hacker and Marathon less useful for them. I highly doubt they soundwhore in this game either (even though it's essentially useless because of the shit sound) meaning Ninja will never be used. Second Chance is the most appealing perk for the average player, and since you will encounter average players the majority of the time, second chance will be used and abused to no end.

I honestly think Black Ops has matured already: Whatever you see now is what you are going to see 6 months from now.

FIFA 13,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"1. Change the menus to something more efficient and less flashy, get rid of the arena player if it means faster menus and no crashing
2. Keep custom formations, but make them less flexible. Use pre-assigned dots on the pitch, rather than being able to push 6 players forward with high workrate etc. like online idiots do
3. Stop making passes in the box less effective just to comb out buggy gameplay, it's unfair and gives advantage to players who just boot it out while being destroyed and get easy goals from open defences
4. Have your defends automatically follow runners so chip through balls aren't as effective, this has been a problem for years and the only way to get around it is to follow the runner yourself, while the AI controlled players on your team stand around not pressuring player on the ball
5. Pair together bad connections and pair together good connections, why should good connections put up with crap connection players. If you want to play at 1 frame per second, do so, but don't tread on me with that crap
6. Fix the stupid bug where the referee is wearing the same kit as one of the teams in head 2 head, how does this even exist and how has it never been patched?
7. Make shooting more erratic so every player doesn't rely on stupid finesse shots every time they shoot

Hey there Dustin Scullion,

Thank you for contacting 2K Support!

We see that you have encountered the issue of your name not showing up in game or on your Jersey. You can attempt a work around by making a new character. When creating the player, please enter in your Last name before entering in your First name. You should then be able to see your name in game and on your jersey for both characters. If this did not work we will need the following:

A clear, Unedited Video showcasing your name is still missing along with your character's stats page.
If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out!

Thanks,

Ring Fit Adventure,[],,,mambo-2,,,[],,,,text,t2_zy6yic,False,,"As others have said, this is a reasonable request, although I think it's going a bit far to call the game very misleading when Nintendo is not in any way trying to hide the fact that the game involves full-body exercises including a leg tracker.

We have fairly limited information right now, but I suspect you're (unfortunately) right that the main adventure mode won't support the level of customization you'd want or need to make the game accessible, but the minigame-based ""sets"" mode does apparently allow exercises to be targeted to particular body parts. Granted, we don't know how much content would be accessible this way and if the main adventure requires full-body motions to progress (which it almost certainly does) that would still lock out the main reason for buying the game. I definitely wouldn't preorder in your position, but depending on what you're hoping to get out of the product, there's still some possibility it might work for you.

One of the reasons I think it's reasonable to complain about this is that it \_shouldn't\_ be obvious that you can't change it. It absolutely \_is\_ possible to make a game like this where you can choose which set of motions can be included in the game. Even for people who don't usually have any mobility issues, having the ability to temporarily exclude exercises would be useful when recovering from injury, so I'm actually somewhat optimistic that this is something Nintendo will include or consider patching in if it's requested enough.",,,,,,,,,,1568706461.0,1568681261,,,,{},f0kkab4,,False,t3_d3ovw2,False,True,t3_d3ovw2,/r/RingFitAdventure/comments/d3ovw2/is_this_really_inclusive/f0kkab4/,,1,,True,False,RingFitAdventure,t5_24q4me,,,,0.0,,,,,1568681262.0,,,,,,,,[],

Assassin's Creed III,,,,Confucius_says,,360,,,The Elusive,,,t2_3sgu1,,,"&gt;people who run in plain sight 

It is very annoying when youre playing manhunt and your teamates do this, I wish there was a way to punish them or let them directly know that theyre not doing good for themselves or the team getting those 100 point scores... 

&gt;people who spend half the game on the roof (I refuse to chase after them)

There are 2 or 3 ways to deal with roof runners

1 - use a gun and shoot them with it

2 - go into a blend group and be on the defensive, wait for someone else to kill your target or wait for your target to come to you. You might feel like your losing points by not actively hunting someone, but you'll get some points while stunning pursuers

3 - when the person is on a nearby roof, WALK in his direction, think about the quickest way to get up to him. If you break the line of sight consider fast walking or a quick jog (holding down RT but not A to go into free running) to get into position faster. You want to bassicaly get on the roof when hes standing on the building right beside you. You want to get on the ledge. If you can do a ledge assassination, you get more points and it looks cool. If you can't then jump on the roof (assuming he's in a very close distance still) and go for a high profile kill. If you do it quickly you'll still get a silent and/or incognito bonus and you may get 300 or more points.. Use your best judgement, sometimes I will mute before doing a roof kill because roof runners tend to use charge and smoke.



----

Whatever you do, don't just get on the roof from too far of a distance and think youre going to chase him down. The target always has the advantage. You want to be as sneaky as possible. If for some reason you start a chase sequence and theres even a doubt in your mind that he'll get away. then don't chase him.

I think free running is the most widely misunderstood aspect of the game because the single player game doesn't punish you properly for doing bad free running.

You want to run on roof tops and free run when you are not in sight of your target (or pursuer). You want to act natural when they can see you.

When you are in sight of your target, you can walk on the roof and avoid detection, just don't hang around for a long time. Eventually your target is going to check the roofs for someone trying to get an arial kill.



If you always walk you'll never get into the right position for a good kill. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1295785647.0,1295760447,,,0.0,,c1dubqr,,,t3_f7dql,,,t3_f7dql,,,3,False,,,assassinscreed,t5_2s6v6,,,,,,,1261719118.0,1.0,1426712999.0,2063.0,,,,,,,,

I will also concede that my almost constant walking gives me significantly lower kills (I think I average around four).  However, the average for my kills is usually in the 400-600 range and has more recently risen to 600-800 now that I've started poisoning (I always enjoy looking at the leaderboard where I have half the kills of the people near me in points).

Usually when I deal with roof runners, I just ignore them until someone else kills them.  If I'm the only pursuer, I'll take them out with the Hidden Gun or chase them down.  Chances are, though, that when my target is a roof runner, I have more points than them and am ahead of them anyways, so survival becomes my prime concern.


One of my pet peeves isn't necessarily something that other people do, but what the game allows you to do.  I hate it when I make a kill and my pursuer is able to walk right up to me and kill me immediately afterward.  It'd be nice to have a way to deal with this.

I've played the My Jordan through a couple of seasons and got used to pressing the right button on the d pad to bring up the play options even if I didn't have the ball. I would often call a pick and roll when I was off the ball, and then let the PG and C create a play.

Now, I've started a My Player as a PF and when I press the right button nothing happens.  This frustrates me endlessly.  Is it because I'm a PF?  Is it because I'm a rookie or a stat is low?

NBA 2K19,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"The worst ""allowing your man to score"" is having a guard against a big in the post.  Of course they're going to get a 5-foot hook shot, there's nothing I can do about it.

I had a draft combine game where Xavier Henry was 3-17 from the field, including 0-7 from 3-point.  It got to the point where I couldn't pass it to him because he would dominate the ball and then jack up a guarded three.  My team lost that game when Wes Johnson hit a fadeaway shot at the buzzer...except he was on my team and we were down by 3.

However, it's still light-years ahead of Elite, a huge improvement from 2K10, and an incredibly entertaining mode if you can get by all the little bugs.  Playing in the NBA (especially if you're lucky enough to be on a decent team) is amazing.

You also really aren't that bad.  Overall ratings are misleading...they're down because your awareness is down, which is a bad indicator of skill.

Or if a player is hurt and limping upcourt, play stops until he gets to his spot.  And you ask for the ball if you have an advantage and get hit with 'bad call for pass.'  

Oh, and the plays that end up getting run make absolutely no sense half the time either.  If i'm coming up on a curl, but there's a second man who went around the screen, avoiding it, you don't throw a pass that would end up just beyond the screener, which will get tipped.  Christ, that's annoying.  And yet I still manage to score 40 a game, but that's only by monopolizing the ball, which i fully realize.

EDIT: Oh, and any time you start getting decent minutes on a team you start pissing off teammates, making their overalls plummet and forcing you to basically carry the team, which gets them even madder.

Playing as a post player is a lot easier because the easiest way to go down a grade is to get scored on and its easier to defend post players. Scoring in the post is pretty easy as well and you can always get a boost to your grade by setting screens. 

Your player rating may be low but like someone else said thats because your awareness is at 25 to start. Work on certain offensive stats and then when you are getting big minutes and more points up that awareness and your overall rating will go up pretty fast.

NBA 2K19,,,,misterFR33ZE,,,,,,,,t2_3227t,,,"* True. Though, you can, off that bat, increase a couple of essential skills. For me, I upgraded my layup and midrange up to or around 80 and that at least allowed me to be of use on offense. It wasn't til mid-season that i was able to up my defensive skills and start getting blocks and steals.

* Also true. On the Knicks right now and pick and rolls work pretty well, but when plays are called, unless it's for stoudemire, I call for the ball (SG, btw).

* Lol, it's frustrating, but bad block and steal attempts don't really do too much harm. Rotating on D, then ""allowing"" your man to score is frustrating, too. I chuckle (on the inside) when I'm leading the league in steals and up there in blocks and the computer has the nerve to tell me I had a poor attempt.

All in all, My Player mode is really enjoyable for me. I think moreso becuase my goals have changed since the update. First season, blocks, 3pts and triple doubles were satisfying, but now that my player is so much better, I actually prefer seeing a balanced box score in a victory to my player dropping 50-20-10 or something.

Once I get better, there will be plenty of other real people to play with online.  All sorts of leagues and online leaderboards that I'm pumped to jump in on as soon as I feel like I'm ready.

I bought one of those ""GT Force"" steering wheels last week off eBay.  There are ups and downs to it.  The upside is that the wheel adds a *ton* of depth and realism to the game.  The wheel rocks back and forth along with your car after sharp turns.  It doesn't ""just"" push back, turning the wheel has a heavy, natural weight to it.  That weight changes as well -- it's really easy to make slight turns at 30MPH but heavy as hell at 100.  The downside is that unlike the normal PS3 controller, the steering wheel fights back when you make mistakes.  This can magnify a small mistake into a much larger one.

Forza 4 looks pretty cool.  I lined up to buy the original and as a fan of the GT series I left disappointed.  Now I'm of the opinion that I'll take any good racing game I can get.

Dragon Age,,,,theDashRendar,,,,,,,,t2_3mcss,,,"3.4 - The Archer [DAOS3.4]

Again, this will be two different builds as you can be an archer as both a 
warrior and a rogue; your choice of base class will have a significant impact 
on how this fighting style performs. The archer's role is to hang back from 
the front lines and pick targets of opportunity to incapacitate and slay one 
at a time (though they do get a rather nasty AoE ability, but only one, so 
you're hardly going to be an AoE powerhouse the way a mage can be). Archers 
make great mage killers and group supporters, and pack a good punch against 
bosses, but can get swamped if they get surrounded by lots of foes, so make 
sure your tank's doing their job. Long charge times on most of their powers 
means that, like mages, archers are at their best when they have some 
breathing room.

3.4a - The Rogue Archer

In general, I feel that rogues are the better base class for archers, since 
their specializations offer better synergy. They might be slightly inferior 
if you're planning on using crossbows, though.

Base Class: Rogue, obviously.

Critical talents:

Melee Archer - at some point, you're going to get hit with melee attacks 
while trying to shoot. Getting disrupted constantly gets old fast.
Critical Shot - great single shot damage.
Arrow of Slaying - this is essentially instant death to the target of your 
choice. It outdamages any other weapon talent in the game by a country mile. 
Get ASAP. Nabbing the 'Heavy Hitter' achievement is laughably easy with this 
talent.
Rapid Shot - this is a great sustained ability for the early game, when you 
don't have access to bows with the Rapid Aim property.
Scattershot - Your one AoE, and it's a beauty, too. One of the best crowd 
control attacks in the game.
Master Archer - makes all your archery talents better, and lets you wear heavy 
armour without any archery drawbacks. What's not to like?

Good talents:

Dirty Fighting - good for getting some breathing space when a pesky enemy 
manages to get into melee range.
Lethality - you'll probably have more Cunning than Strength as a rogue, so 
you may as well capitalize on it. Too bad the critical hit bonus only affects 
melee. You can ignore this talent if you're planning on using crossbows.
Aim - a decent sustained mode for enemies with very high defense, or for when 
you're under the effects of a Misdirection Hex.
Suppressing Fire - a sustained mode that makes every shot debuff enemy attack 
scores, and it stacks, too. Can be paired up with other sustained archery 
abilities, like Rapid Shot.
Pinning Shot - good for keeping an enemy at range when you get the jump on 
them.
Crippling Shot - a handy debuff for boss fights.
Defensive Fire - you may wish to toss this on if your tank loses hostility 
and you find yourself in hot water.

Specializations:

Bard - one of the best specializations to pair up with archery, especially if 
your goal is to be a supporter for the rest of your team. The bard song buffs 
affect your whole party even if they're not near you. The stat bonuses are 
useful as well.
Duelist - another great specialization for archers. While two of the four 
talents are largely useless, the benefits of the Dueling sustained are very 
helpful.
Ranger - this specialization pairs up better with archers than dual wielders, 
as it provides another party member to distract things and keep them out of 
your hair.
Assassin - probably the least useful specialization for an archer, as you 
won't be inflicting backstabs. The Dexterity bonus is quite nice, but aside 
from that, it's not a good pairing.

General stat spread:

Strength - 20 modified (or whatever your gear of choice demands for prereqs)
Dexterity - generally very high; see below
Willpower - 20 modified or more
Magic - irrelevant
Cunning - moderate to high; see below
Constitution - irrelevant

There's generally two ways that I feel would be effective in building a rogue 
archer, though your actual preference may fall somewhere a bit outside or 
between these two. The common elements of both are only getting enough 
modified Strength to satisfy equipment requirements - this will be higher if 
you want to use heavier armour or high tier crossbows. Willpower shouldn't be 
too low, since you'll want to have a sustained ability or two running but 
still be able to make good use of all your active talents, which tend to be 
quite costly. The various bonuses you get to Constitution as you go through 
the game should be enough to give you a decent pool of  hit points, so I 
wouldn't recommend raising it much, if at all. The main differences between 
the two variants will be how you distribute your stat points between 
Dexterity and Cunning.

Variant 1: DEX stacking

This build raises Cunning enough to make your rogue skills perform at a high 
enough level to get you through the game (30 modified), and puts the rest of 
your remaining points into Dexterity. The benefits of this are that you will 
get both good damage and good accuracy out of any ranged weapon you choose. 
It's particularly valuable to crossbow rogues, as Cunning will have no effect 
on their damage. DEX stacking also has the added value of giving you great 
dodging ability, meaning that you can tank quite well in a pinch.

Variant 2: DEX/CUN balancing

This build is oriented toward longbow and shortbow rogues, particularly those 
who wish to get the most out of the Bard specialization. In this build, you 
will still have a lot of Dexterity, but you will also want to invest a fair 
bit in your Cunning stat, getting it to modified values of 50 or more. While 
this will cost you in terms of accuracy and your dodging ability, you won't 
lose any damage, and will in fact do better damage against heavily armoured 
targets due to the bonus to armour penetration from high Cunning scores. You 
will also be an outstanding skill user even if you don't get the maximum rank 
for those skills, which can allow you to get a greater breadth of skills or 
save a talent on lockpicking. Because of your lowered dodging ability, you may 
wish to invest a bit more in Constitution than a DEX stacker would, or 
possibly wear medium or heavy armour rather than light armour. This build 
will generally have lower solo performance than the Dexterity-stacked 
variant, but will make a better group supporter.

Difficulty rating:

Early game - Very hard
Mid game - Hard to average
Late game - Average to easy

Dragon Age,,,,kinggimped,,,,,,,,t2_3llqd,,,"I'm using Leliana as my archer (along with Warden-Mage/Alistair-Tank/Wynne-Healer). Somewhere around level 12-13 she started being really useful (before that, she was only really there to open locked chests).

Archers are next to useless at the start of the game but around the mid-game they start to be quite useful. Get Scattershot as soon as you can, as it's one of the best crowd control abilities in the game (group damage + stun). Master Archer improves all your archery abilities and allows you to wear heavy armour without the attack speed penalty, so that's a no-brainer. Get those as soon as possible.

Arrow of Slaying does a *lot* of damage (the first time I tried the ability it one-shotted a yellow enemy, about 270 damage), but I've found that it uses up too much stamina. I should have given Leliana more willpower, I guess, seeing as she's always singing. It does do a lot of damage, though (she's at level 20 currently and it's pretty much a one shot kill on most enemies, although I rarely have the stamina to spare).

Get bows with rapid aim as soon as you can, it saves you needing to have the Rapid Shot ability on all the time.

Get a good relationship with Leliana (easy by talking to her in camp and being flattering, and by giving her [gifts](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Gifts#Gifts_for_Leliana) - there are a few Andraste's Grace flowers scattered around the game; one in the Brecilian Forest, one in the Elven Alienage in Denerim, and a few others besides. These give you +9 to approval each time, I think). Eventually she'll talk about her past (specifically about Marjolaine), and tell her that you'll find her when you get to Denerim.

Once you get to Denerim, go to Marjolaine's house. You can either fight her (it's not a particularly difficult fight) or persuade her to leave. After she's done with, there's a chest in her house with pretty much the best bow for Leliana - Marjolaine's Recurve. Once I got that she really started vindicating my choice of having her in my party.

Even so, I still wish I had taken Zevran and made him into a super dual-wielder. Archery is all well and good but having someone doing stealthy backstabs during combat would be nice, especially given how good a tank Alistair becomes if you level him up right.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1293970979.0,1293945779,,,0.0,,c1b48zu,,,t3_eubwu,,,t3_eubwu,,,3,False,,,dragonage,t5_2r8lo,,,,,,,1251058816.0,1.0,1426666369.0,112505.0,,,,,,,,

Also consider getting the [Advanced Tactics](http://www.dragonagenexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=181) mod, it gives you more options for combat slots, but also slightly improves archer behaviours so they're not so keen to switch to melee weapons. One problem I had with Leliana is that when an enemy's within a couple of feet of her, she'll pull out her dual blades and start thwacking him (and usually missing due to her poor strength) instead of peppering him with arrows from where she is.

The Sims 3,,,,MeShackAndBendAndGo,,,,,,,,t2_arwh8,,,"I absolutely love it.  

If you score really well on the Amplitude test, you get 18 free credits, so it only takes 2 terms of rigorous courses to finish.  If you do Science, you'll come out with a job making $290 an hour at the Science Facility.  

One thing that does bother me though (but probably shouldn't), there is only one algorithm for the pool game.  Four in off break, makes two stripes, misses the third, etc.  Every time.

Social networking is pretty neat but not essential or ingrained into the game enough to really make it useful.

I would prefer the school terms to be a bit longer: about 2 weeks would be good.  You really don't get to explore the world in one week and do everything you would like to.

Not related to the game, I don't think, but still super useful, the new update (I think) allows Sims to be paid when they work at home.  Workaholic trait is now an absolute must for anyone.  Also, if you want to do well on the Amplitude test to get scholarships, the genius trait is very nice to have.

The Sims 3,,,,kittydorkdork,,,,,,,,,,,"I've only sent one Sim to school so far but it was fun. I enrolled her for 2 weeks, 18 credits. I thought it reflected a real scheduled pretty well and she barely had any free time on her hands. 

I kept her grade bar filled up in hopes of getting something special out of it, like a job offer maybe? Nope. Maybe it's because the game tweaked and she missed the first class on the first day. 

The 2 weeks seemed long enough to me. I was itching to get her back home because I had toddlers and was wondering if they would age up while I was gone. I had heard that time moved slow... but no, absolutely no time passed, much like when you go away on vacation. And oddly enough, it was winter when she left for school, summer during school, and winter still when she came back. Wat. 

I like the choices between dorms, sorority/paternity/house, that you get to bring the entire household's money with you and a car. I love the new smartphone and the ability to blog. The social group things seem interesting. I have a set of triplets I'm going to send to university so I'm excited to see how that plays out.

Tactical Defending - Contain.  
Tactical Defending - New Opportunities.  
Dribbling - Jog Speed Turn Radius.  
Precision Dribbling - Precision Turn Radius.  
Precision Dribbling - Dribble While Shielding.  
Compares FIFA 11 Tackling Physics with the New Impact Engine Tackling (WOW! What a difference! I mean, WOW!)  

Impact Engine - Shielding.  

Impact Engine - Unexpected Behaviors (Shows an AWESOME animation of a defender coming in, offensive player makes a move and does a flip)  

Impact Engine - Variety (Shows a defender taking out a player that is going after the ball)  

Impact Engine - Contextual Dribble Turns (Shows a player tapping the ball ahead, just a bit, then jumping to avoid a sliding tackle)  

Impact Engine - Difficult Situations (Shows a player trying to kick the ball, but hits the other players foot instead and falls over)  

Impact Engine - Shared Collisions (Shows 2 players going after the ball, each player had his own animation, depending on situation. In this particular one, it showed a player reaching out to kick a ball and the defender trying the same, after the ball is touched, the players lose balance and just looks very real.)  

Impact Engine - True Injuries (Woah... Shows a player getting roughed up, trying to advance the ball, he lands awkwardly on his right knee, after a little act job, he grabs his knee and gets up, gingerly)
  
True Injuries - Self Injuries (Damn, this is a great video. Anyways, this shows a player getting injured with nobody around him, looked like a strained groin and the defender takes the ball away)  

True Injuries - Re-Injury (Shows a player getting tripped up and waving to the sidelines for someone to get him or sub in for him)  

Impact Engine - Pushing and Pulling - Shows players pushing and pulling for position.  ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1306339450.0,1306314250,,,0.0,,c1vwsa6,,,t3_hj86h,,,t3_hj86h,,,3,False,,,FIFA12,t5_2sika,,,,,,,1274733461.0,1.0,1427179305.0,41934.0,,,,,,,,

- Players will be even more different from each other. In FIFA 11, the players different skillsets really showed through, comparing to earlier versions. In this game, players ""style of play"" will also be considered. 

- Impossible blind passing is no longer possible, unless you have players like Cesc Fabregas covering each position on your team.

- Tottenham will likely take much more advantage of Crouch, and we will no longer see teams like Barcelona crossing with each chance they get.

Players will have their own style of play, and will be aware of their teammates capabilities. 

With regards to the keepers, I agree. In some situations, they are truly pitiful, and some evenings, they seem to be the deciding factor between winning and losing. Especially with the finesse shot, from the corner of the field, to the far corner. There are definitely some ""exploits"", and ways that almost guarantee goals. 

I don't play online myself, but the fact that people just quit whenever they are behind, seems to be the number one complaint I hear, when my mates discuss FIFA. I EA finds a fix for it, but then again, I'm not sure how they *could* fix it.

I really don't see upgradeable players as something that will happen in online play, no matter how awesome it sounds. But in manager mode? That would  simply just be amazing.

""Taking a sharp turn away from the lush island jungles of the top-rated Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4 is set in Kyrat, an untamed region currently ruled by a despotic self-appointed king. But don't be lulled into a false sense of security by the achingly beautiful views; Kyrat is a wild land full of perils. Once again, players will be able to craft their own stories as they travel through this exotic open world teeming with wildlife – using their wits along with an assortment of powerful weapons and diverse vehicles.

""Following the success of Far Cry 3, we wanted to take the franchise to the next level and create a game that will surprise players and exceed fans' expectations,"" said Dan Hay, Executive Producer. ""Given the unique setting, we feel Far Cry 4 will stand out as a top first-person shooter and we're eager to reveal more about the game in the coming months.""",,,,,,,,0.0,,1400202933.0,1400177733,,,0.0,,chit3eu,,,t3_25n743,,,t3_25n743,,,1,False,,,FarCry4,t5_2vtua,,,,,,,1363951825.0,1.0,1433810780.0,507.0,,,,,,,,

I heard rumors that the covenant are there but if they are there from the end of Ghosts of onyx or not is up for debate... and who knows if they are allies or enemies but if the rumors are true then I guess they start off either enemies or allies and then switch sides half-way through. Oh and remember its a shield world so there are forerunners - which again seeing as how the new trilogy of Halo books focuses on the forerunners it again looks like they have been planning this for a long time.

* The end goal (and the key to winning) is not depleting your opponent's life first, but rather having more health when time runs out.

Effectively this promotes turtling in the highest sense, but it's one of the more worthwhile pieces of advice I've ever been given. Playing the runaway playstyle is completely and 100% legitimate. It may seem less honorable, but when playing to win (especially when there's money on the line), there really shouldn't be any other goal in mind.

It is very annoying when youre playing manhunt and your teamates do this, I wish there was a way to punish them or let them directly know that theyre not doing good for themselves or the team getting those 100 point scores... 

&gt;people who spend half the game on the roof (I refuse to chase after them)

There are 2 or 3 ways to deal with roof runners

1 - use a gun and shoot them with it

2 - go into a blend group and be on the defensive, wait for someone else to kill your target or wait for your target to come to you. You might feel like your losing points by not actively hunting someone, but you'll get some points while stunning pursuers

3 - when the person is on a nearby roof, WALK in his direction, think about the quickest way to get up to him. If you break the line of sight consider fast walking or a quick jog (holding down RT but not A to go into free running) to get into position faster. You want to bassicaly get on the roof when hes standing on the building right beside you. You want to get on the ledge. If you can do a ledge assassination, you get more points and it looks cool. If you can't then jump on the roof (assuming he's in a very close distance still) and go for a high profile kill. If you do it quickly you'll still get a silent and/or incognito bonus and you may get 300 or more points.. Use your best judgement, sometimes I will mute before doing a roof kill because roof runners tend to use charge and smoke.



----

Whatever you do, don't just get on the roof from too far of a distance and think youre going to chase him down. The target always has the advantage. You want to be as sneaky as possible. If for some reason you start a chase sequence and theres even a doubt in your mind that he'll get away. then don't chase him.

I think free running is the most widely misunderstood aspect of the game because the single player game doesn't punish you properly for doing bad free running.

You want to run on roof tops and free run when you are not in sight of your target (or pursuer). You want to act natural when they can see you.

When you are in sight of your target, you can walk on the roof and avoid detection, just don't hang around for a long time. Eventually your target is going to check the roofs for someone trying to get an arial kill.



If you always walk you'll never get into the right position for a good kill. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1295785647.0,1295760447,,,0.0,,c1dubqr,,,t3_f7dql,,,t3_f7dql,,,3,False,,,assassinscreed,t5_2s6v6,,,,,,,1261719118.0,1.0,1426712999.0,2063.0,,,,,,,,

I will also concede that my almost constant walking gives me significantly lower kills (I think I average around four).  However, the average for my kills is usually in the 400-600 range and has more recently risen to 600-800 now that I've started poisoning (I always enjoy looking at the leaderboard where I have half the kills of the people near me in points).

Usually when I deal with roof runners, I just ignore them until someone else kills them.  If I'm the only pursuer, I'll take them out with the Hidden Gun or chase them down.  Chances are, though, that when my target is a roof runner, I have more points than them and am ahead of them anyways, so survival becomes my prime concern.


One of my pet peeves isn't necessarily something that other people do, but what the game allows you to do.  I hate it when I make a kill and my pursuer is able to walk right up to me and kill me immediately afterward.  It'd be nice to have a way to deal with this.

Assassin's Creed,,,,Confucius_says,,360,,,The Elusive,,,t2_3sgu1,,,"&gt;people who run in plain sight 

It is very annoying when youre playing manhunt and your teamates do this, I wish there was a way to punish them or let them directly know that theyre not doing good for themselves or the team getting those 100 point scores... 

&gt;people who spend half the game on the roof (I refuse to chase after them)

There are 2 or 3 ways to deal with roof runners

1 - use a gun and shoot them with it

2 - go into a blend group and be on the defensive, wait for someone else to kill your target or wait for your target to come to you. You might feel like your losing points by not actively hunting someone, but you'll get some points while stunning pursuers

3 - when the person is on a nearby roof, WALK in his direction, think about the quickest way to get up to him. If you break the line of sight consider fast walking or a quick jog (holding down RT but not A to go into free running) to get into position faster. You want to bassicaly get on the roof when hes standing on the building right beside you. You want to get on the ledge. If you can do a ledge assassination, you get more points and it looks cool. If you can't then jump on the roof (assuming he's in a very close distance still) and go for a high profile kill. If you do it quickly you'll still get a silent and/or incognito bonus and you may get 300 or more points.. Use your best judgement, sometimes I will mute before doing a roof kill because roof runners tend to use charge and smoke.



----

Whatever you do, don't just get on the roof from too far of a distance and think youre going to chase him down. The target always has the advantage. You want to be as sneaky as possible. If for some reason you start a chase sequence and theres even a doubt in your mind that he'll get away. then don't chase him.

I think free running is the most widely misunderstood aspect of the game because the single player game doesn't punish you properly for doing bad free running.

You want to run on roof tops and free run when you are not in sight of your target (or pursuer). You want to act natural when they can see you.

When you are in sight of your target, you can walk on the roof and avoid detection, just don't hang around for a long time. Eventually your target is going to check the roofs for someone trying to get an arial kill.



If you always walk you'll never get into the right position for a good kill. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1295785647.0,1295760447,,,0.0,,c1dubqr,,,t3_f7dql,,,t3_f7dql,,,3,False,,,assassinscreed,t5_2s6v6,,,,,,,1261719118.0,1.0,1426712999.0,2063.0,,,,,,,,

I will also concede that my almost constant walking gives me significantly lower kills (I think I average around four).  However, the average for my kills is usually in the 400-600 range and has more recently risen to 600-800 now that I've started poisoning (I always enjoy looking at the leaderboard where I have half the kills of the people near me in points).

Usually when I deal with roof runners, I just ignore them until someone else kills them.  If I'm the only pursuer, I'll take them out with the Hidden Gun or chase them down.  Chances are, though, that when my target is a roof runner, I have more points than them and am ahead of them anyways, so survival becomes my prime concern.


One of my pet peeves isn't necessarily something that other people do, but what the game allows you to do.  I hate it when I make a kill and my pursuer is able to walk right up to me and kill me immediately afterward.  It'd be nice to have a way to deal with this.

As far as I know, Namco didn't plan on reversing one's camera back to the way the player requested every time a side change happens, merely at the start of a round. And even then, that's a very welcome change. Tekken's movement mechanics require you to perform certain advanced motions with a stick / on a pad (b,b,n,d/b~b for a backdash cancel, f,n,d~d/f,f for a wavedash), and since it's very important to use these types of movement, it's not uncommon for people to be less skilled in these on either of the sides due to various factors. This coupled with the fact that a side change in Tekken does not happen too often (you can't just jump over a standing opponent) allows people to play on their preferred side for the majority of the match, and this new system greatly helps them in that regard.

Throws cause side changes often, but that's only the case for 2-throws, 1 and 1+2-throws generally leave the player on the side he was on previously both on break and on a successful grapple.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1422501767.0,1422476567,,,0.0,,co3uu86,,,t3_2sk7xo,,,t1_cnq8aue,,,2,False,,,Tekken7,t5_32k3a,,,,,,,1336077135.0,2.0,1424339073.0,1117158.0,,,,,,,,

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,,,,Confucius_says,,360,,,The Elusive,,,t2_3sgu1,,,"&gt;people who run in plain sight 

It is very annoying when youre playing manhunt and your teamates do this, I wish there was a way to punish them or let them directly know that theyre not doing good for themselves or the team getting those 100 point scores... 

&gt;people who spend half the game on the roof (I refuse to chase after them)

There are 2 or 3 ways to deal with roof runners

1 - use a gun and shoot them with it

2 - go into a blend group and be on the defensive, wait for someone else to kill your target or wait for your target to come to you. You might feel like your losing points by not actively hunting someone, but you'll get some points while stunning pursuers

3 - when the person is on a nearby roof, WALK in his direction, think about the quickest way to get up to him. If you break the line of sight consider fast walking or a quick jog (holding down RT but not A to go into free running) to get into position faster. You want to bassicaly get on the roof when hes standing on the building right beside you. You want to get on the ledge. If you can do a ledge assassination, you get more points and it looks cool. If you can't then jump on the roof (assuming he's in a very close distance still) and go for a high profile kill. If you do it quickly you'll still get a silent and/or incognito bonus and you may get 300 or more points.. Use your best judgement, sometimes I will mute before doing a roof kill because roof runners tend to use charge and smoke.



----

Whatever you do, don't just get on the roof from too far of a distance and think youre going to chase him down. The target always has the advantage. You want to be as sneaky as possible. If for some reason you start a chase sequence and theres even a doubt in your mind that he'll get away. then don't chase him.

I think free running is the most widely misunderstood aspect of the game because the single player game doesn't punish you properly for doing bad free running.

You want to run on roof tops and free run when you are not in sight of your target (or pursuer). You want to act natural when they can see you.

When you are in sight of your target, you can walk on the roof and avoid detection, just don't hang around for a long time. Eventually your target is going to check the roofs for someone trying to get an arial kill.



If you always walk you'll never get into the right position for a good kill. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1295785647.0,1295760447,,,0.0,,c1dubqr,,,t3_f7dql,,,t3_f7dql,,,3,False,,,assassinscreed,t5_2s6v6,,,,,,,1261719118.0,1.0,1426712999.0,2063.0,,,,,,,,
Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"I agree that there can definitely be a time and a use for running, it just seems that many people have no idea when that is.

I will also concede that my almost constant walking gives me significantly lower kills (I think I average around four).  However, the average for my kills is usually in the 400-600 range and has more recently risen to 600-800 now that I've started poisoning (I always enjoy looking at the leaderboard where I have half the kills of the people near me in points).  I think probably a quarter to a third of my points come from stuns and a pursuer killing the wrong person.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1295787283.0,1295762083,,,0.0,,c1dues3,,,t3_f7dql,,,t1_c1dubqr,,,2,False,,,assassinscreed,t5_2s6v6,,,,,,,,2.0,1426713039.0,1636.0,,,,,,,,

Usually when I deal with roof runners, I just ignore them until someone else kills them.  If I'm the only pursuer, I'll take them out with the Hidden Gun or chase them down.  Chances are, though, that when my target is a roof runner, I have more points than them and am ahead of them anyways, so survival becomes my prime concern.


One of my pet peeves isn't necessarily something that other people do, but what the game allows you to do.  I hate it when I make a kill and my pursuer is able to walk right up to me and kill me immediately afterward.  It'd be nice to have a way to deal with this.

The choreography doesn't feel too outdated, and the songs that have repeated choreography (*:cough: ""I Love It""*) at least have interesting background music videos to go along with it. I think my favorite feature is the fact that you can see your world ranking online, and it makes you want to replay the song to get better and better at your score (which in turn helps extend the life of the game with replay value).

It still sucks, because so much of their DLC is not only old songs, but $3 for a song to replay again after I've played it a thousand times three years ago.

Or even not popular tracks. The idea of DLC is to continue the game's life cycle. I stopped playing JD 2015 a long time ago because I got bored.

Apart from that, they seem to be focusing on Just Dance Now a lot (the game has already +100 tracks and they are adding JD2015 songs now). I understand that they want to reach to a lot of people, but people who already played the game on Kinect or with the PS4 Camera won't go back to motion controllers. I wish they did a JD Now App for consoles as well. 

I will add another complaint on JD 2015: why the hell there is less content? JD 2014 had a lot of Sweat versions, Extreme versions, mash ups, on-stage songs. This one only had 8. 8!

It is very annoying when youre playing manhunt and your teamates do this, I wish there was a way to punish them or let them directly know that theyre not doing good for themselves or the team getting those 100 point scores... 

&gt;people who spend half the game on the roof (I refuse to chase after them)

There are 2 or 3 ways to deal with roof runners

1 - use a gun and shoot them with it

2 - go into a blend group and be on the defensive, wait for someone else to kill your target or wait for your target to come to you. You might feel like your losing points by not actively hunting someone, but you'll get some points while stunning pursuers

3 - when the person is on a nearby roof, WALK in his direction, think about the quickest way to get up to him. If you break the line of sight consider fast walking or a quick jog (holding down RT but not A to go into free running) to get into position faster. You want to bassicaly get on the roof when hes standing on the building right beside you. You want to get on the ledge. If you can do a ledge assassination, you get more points and it looks cool. If you can't then jump on the roof (assuming he's in a very close distance still) and go for a high profile kill. If you do it quickly you'll still get a silent and/or incognito bonus and you may get 300 or more points.. Use your best judgement, sometimes I will mute before doing a roof kill because roof runners tend to use charge and smoke.



----

Whatever you do, don't just get on the roof from too far of a distance and think youre going to chase him down. The target always has the advantage. You want to be as sneaky as possible. If for some reason you start a chase sequence and theres even a doubt in your mind that he'll get away. then don't chase him.

I think free running is the most widely misunderstood aspect of the game because the single player game doesn't punish you properly for doing bad free running.

You want to run on roof tops and free run when you are not in sight of your target (or pursuer). You want to act natural when they can see you.

When you are in sight of your target, you can walk on the roof and avoid detection, just don't hang around for a long time. Eventually your target is going to check the roofs for someone trying to get an arial kill.



If you always walk you'll never get into the right position for a good kill. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1295785647.0,1295760447,,,0.0,,c1dubqr,,,t3_f7dql,,,t3_f7dql,,,3,False,,,assassinscreed,t5_2s6v6,,,,,,,1261719118.0,1.0,1426712999.0,2063.0,,,,,,,,

I will also concede that my almost constant walking gives me significantly lower kills (I think I average around four).  However, the average for my kills is usually in the 400-600 range and has more recently risen to 600-800 now that I've started poisoning (I always enjoy looking at the leaderboard where I have half the kills of the people near me in points).

Usually when I deal with roof runners, I just ignore them until someone else kills them.  If I'm the only pursuer, I'll take them out with the Hidden Gun or chase them down.  Chances are, though, that when my target is a roof runner, I have more points than them and am ahead of them anyways, so survival becomes my prime concern.


One of my pet peeves isn't necessarily something that other people do, but what the game allows you to do.  I hate it when I make a kill and my pursuer is able to walk right up to me and kill me immediately afterward.  It'd be nice to have a way to deal with this.

Now that I think about it, it *will* be full of RPG elements, such as combining objects to make something new. I believe I read somewhere where if she wants to build something, but doesn't have the correct herb (say) then she will to go out and search for it. That's RPG all the way.

In other words, this new game isn't really a prequel. It just throws out the whole canon because none of the other games, which supposedly happen in her future, make sense otherwise.

It's a completely new game. I think they just used the ""Lara Croft"" name to gain some traction. I hope it's a success but unless they keep enough of the traditional aspects of TR it might alienate a lot of the fans. On the other hand, TR has a ton of female fans and this new RPG styling might really appeal to them.

Yeah, like you said, ""they totally killed tomb raider here and only thing left is lara that can remind us of that good old times."" Time will tell. It's still a long way off.

Rise of the Tomb Raider,,,,Tonkarz,,,,,,,,t2_4xurg,,,"The old Tomb Raider games were good for the time. When Tomb Raider came out, it did a lot of things that no other game had done. But it sucked in a lot of ways. Moving Lara around was difficult and infamously awkward, combat was a boring chore and the levels were all blocky and ugly.

All of the old Tomb Raider games suffered from these issues. Angel of Darkness may have dropped the blocky levels, but it still suffered from the other two problems (and there were many other issues with the game, mostly related to how it was barely out of Alpha on release i.e. totally and completely unfinished; a buggy mess).

Legend, Anniversary and Underworld did have shorter levels, but this is beside the point. What really matters is that the games were shorter overall. The puzzles were easier too. Part of this was because Lara was far easier to control, but it is mostly due to how expensive and difficult games are to make these days. But long levels, hard puzzles or an open world were not the things that made Tomb Raider fun, interesting or entertaining. What made the old Tomb Raider games entertaining was exploring and navigating the environments.

The three Crystal Dynamics games improved on this a lot. Lara can do a lot more stuff in this regard, not to mention her grappling hook. They also made Lara easier to move and fight with. They put it stuff to find around the levels, and improved the camera and environments. They are better games overall. 

The newest Tomb Raider game appears to have some RPG elements (like AoD was supposed to have). Certainly not loaded with them (unless they start talking about ability scores and skill points), but it does have some. But why is this a bad thing? If it works, it will be a lot of fun. 

For the most part, this RPG elements will mean the game will have exactly the type of content you lamented as being missing from the newer Tomb Raider games. Only instead of hunting down an arbitrary item (some key that is, for some reason, lying around in a room on the other side of the level) you hunt down a specific item so you can make something that improves Lara's abilities in some significant way. Not to mention that you will be doing so in the context of an open world.

As far as Lara being inexperienced, this game is about how she becomes the experienced and capable Tomb Raider we all know. She might start out weak but she'll get better over the course of the game until she is an ass kicking heroine worthy of the Lara Croft name. 

Of course, this is just theory. The game isn't out yet, so it could suck mightily, but don't give up on it so soon. Everything we've seen suggests that it'll be pretty good, if not one of the best games next year.

tl;dr Old Tomb Raider games suck, new Tomb Raider games good, play new Tomb Raider before deciding it sucks.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1313616872.0,1313591672,,,0.0,,c2d42al,,,t3_jlg4a,,,t3_jlg4a,,,1,False,,,TombRaider,t5_2sk5x,,,,,,,1299675702.0,1.0,1427482876.0,17125.0,,,,,,,,
Rise of the Tomb Raider,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed both ""eras"" for what they were: action-adventure and puzzle games starring a tall, big-breasted English woman who had a sexy voice, wore skimpy clothing, and kicked some serious ass.

Now having said that, I appreciate the backstory that the developers have cultivated and the humanizing elements that have been introduced these last few games. However, the Tomb Raider canon has always been a bit of a mess. Rebooting this franchise is the right thing to do. Clarify her backstory, give her generous but believable proportions, and show us how she became this sexy, driven, and adventurous woman that will risk her life for ancient artifacts.

Just because this new story focuses on the survival elements of her original adventure doesn't mean that the aspects we've grown to love will be absent in the future.

Those games were similar to TR and raised my expectations for the action genre.  The Uncharted series has changed how people look at action games and to keep up, TR has to make some changes.  So in order to keep Lara alive, TR had to undergo some innovations to keep up with Uncharted.  I'm looking forward to the changes simply because I love both Uncharted and TR, they are both great series.  Mostly, I'm looking forward to the open island aspect.

&gt;The poster using Underworld Lara isn’t indicative of a long-term partnership with McDonalds. McDonalds was looking to put together a campaign featuring iconic characters, and asked if we’d allow them to include Lara alongside other pop-culture personas as Darth Vadar, King Kong, and even the dude from Scream. It made sense to use a more traditional version of Lara instead of the less-identifiable and younger version. I think the campaign is actually drawing to a close, so I’m not sure they will be around much longer.

According to them, but Mafia 3 will most likely not make the starting state for the next game consoles, but will be sometime later in their life cycle. How do these sources said, the game is still at an early stage and it is not much to show to the public, so at Gamescom next week certainly will not be presented.

Worse, the development of the third part according to our information again suffer not only the constant remodeling of all it produced (going to have even two, is not ambitious studies nothing special), but also current base in Brno study authors, which apparently is a much bigger problem.

Ark: Survival Evolved,,,,sirace135,,,,,,,,t2_i1mh8,,,"**[NA East, NYC] LETHAL SHADOWS | 24/7 | Active Admins | PVP/PVE | Growing Server!**
New Server!Come join us on the Lethal Shadows Ark! Where we have a great community! 
No cheaters! Very active, fun, mature server. Get in and start building while we are new and grow with us!

This Ark is as close to official servers as possible and when the game matures more and everyone is further along we may ramp up the difficulty of the game (tougher Dino's with better drops).

**Rules:**

* No KOS for fresh spawns: IE: Don't kill new players (Active Admins are watching)
* RP Initiation is encouraged
* Zero greifing policy
* Raiding is allowed 
* Tribe's are encouraged to help each other or declare war on one another
* No racism
* No misogynistic chat/VoIP

**Griefing:** The unprovoked and/or repeated destruction of a player/tribe and/or their structures and dinos. Emphasis on the unprovoked portion. This is a survival game, play nice with your neighbors because they CAN kill you if provoked. If you raid someone, kill someone, shoot at someone, talk enough trash or kill someone's Dino or structure, its go time!

**How to Connect:**
**Server IP :** 71.190.184.243:27015

**Use Steams Server Browser to do this or find us in the unofficial ARK server list**
* 1. With Steam Main program open
* 2. Navigate to View (top bar) and click Servers
* 3. Go to Favorites
* 4. Select Add a Server
* 5. Enter the IP and port attached [ 71.190.184.243:27015 ] and Add or Find a game and add to Favorites
* 5.1 Sometimes it will show up and then disappear, when it shows up just stop the 'stop refresh' button and it will stay

**[OR CLICK HERE!](steam://connect/71.190.184.243:27015)**

**Team Speak**
A TeamSpeak server is provided for the server! So check us out at www.lethalshadows.com, click on the teamspeak link on the right side so join us. Or just click this link teamspeak://lethalshadows.enjinvoice.com

I play solo since the one time I tried to get someone I knew to play a bunch of crap came up in his life, which happens. I also know about the online crap of invincibility shields and Shredder Shredder hackguns that kill stars, so I don't go out there. C'est la vie.

Anyways, I use Racers since the Lancer and Monster Cheta Paw are both too damn slow. I've repeatably taken on four of the spiders in the sunken sea with a Scavenger Mord using a lv67-ish Dahl Bulldog (twenty round shotgun ZPR1200D version). A good Panacea really helps out with this shit. You may also want to keep a nice Defender to keep the Dog fed and occasionally deliver the mail if you get jumped.


However, I die horribly and quickly *every time* I go see Crawmerax no matter who I send out and what guns I use. The damn House Spiders, Knoxx, Lance; I can kick ass on all day, but the crawfish gang eats me like a slightly spicy cajun snack.

Of course everything in second playthough starts off at 32 so I'm still one shotting everything ;_; but I figure I might just rush through the main story, skip the extra quests and her me started on playthrough 3 where everything is supposed to be the same level as me.

Mass Effect 3,,,,BarkingToad,,alliance,,,,,,t2_3gb2b,,,"Three things I'd point out:

 1. Grenades! In the first game, there is no reload button. Instead, the 'R' button (assuming you're playing on PC, otherwise I have no clue) is instead bound to ""Throw/Detonate grenade"". If you're a compulsive reloader, like me, this *will* cost you grenades. Don't worry, though, there are plenty of grenades to be found along the way. In ME2, the reload function was reintroduced, and there are no grenades (except if you have the grenade launcher), so this only applies to the first game.

 2. The Mako/Planetscan in ME1/ME2 are really *really* annoying/dull. But the storyline is worth sucking it up and pushing through anyway.

 3. Biotics. Being a biotic, whether Vanguard or Adept, is really powerful, especially in ME1, but still pretty damn good in ME2. Enemy biotics are equally powerful, however, so be careful. Especially in ME1, enemy biotics can really be a pain in the posterior. Concentrate fire on enemy biotics first.

Mass Effect 3,,,,Thursdame,,,,,,,,t2_4b4w4,,,"* Like in all good RPGs, talk to your companions.  Garrus and Wrex both have personal quests for you to do for them.  At VERY least, do Wrex's quest before going to a planet called Virmire (it's a major story planet).  Seriously.
Tali also has a personal quest but you don't know about it until after you've completed the story mission, then she'll ask you for the data you receive.

* It's really not necessary to scour every planet for every resource or hidden cache.  Even if you want to complete the mineral / artifact gathering missions, you can easily do so by scanning every planet from orbit that it allows you to, doing a quick look at every asteroid field, and then when you're on a planet, just stop at what you come across while heading to objectives you can see on the map.  If you do all of the planets, you'll both be rich and complete all the quests this way.  Don't spend more time than necessary looking for things.

* If you find yourself hating the mako, it's not necessary to do all the sidequests.  Do the ones you come across that sound interesting, or (Except for Wrex's) don't do them at all.  It DOES help your understanding of Mass Effect 2 and you get to see a few extra things when you import your save if you do more in ME1 but if you think the mako is too tedious and you find yourself not enjoying the game, just do the major story planets and be done with it.  The story is the best thing in ME1.   If you hate the combat, just knock it down to the easiest level and go from there.

* It's a good idea to pick paragon or Renegade and make mostly choices going one way or the other.  You can make the occasional choice the other way, but if you try and split things, you won't be far enough up either ladder for some dialogue choices up the line.

Mass Effect 3,,,,JediPilot,,,,,,,,t2_4a93e,,,"* Okay, first of all, you don't need to go Biotic to have fun. The biotic powers are more flashy and obvious in their effects on combat, but the tech abilities are extremely useful as well. I just did my first playthrough on the hardest difficulty and it wasn't hard at all. You just need to have a strategic mindset and know which powers control the battle in which ways. The biotic powers are really good for giving you breathing room, relieving pressure if some fucking Krogan asshole is charging you. You can throw him across the room. Biotics help you control space. Tech powers, I find, help you actually disable and fuck with the enemy. Sabotage overheats enemy weapons, which completely stops anyone who's hit from firing on you. AI hacking a Geth Prime (making it shoot anything it sees) can single handedly turn a battle around. Overload completely rapes shields and leveling up that skill gives you more shields and lets you repair the MAKO much, much faster. Damping stops enemies from using their powers. IMO, warp is actually the best biotic power, because it makes enemies take more damage, but it's not FLASHY. It may depend on what difficulty you're playing on. I found on the harder difficulties, the speed at which I was able to kill a single enemy was the most important thing. Pushing guys around doesn't help if it still takes 5 minutes of continuous fire to down them.
  
* The biggest problem with Mass Effect 1, imo, is the combat duing the side missions on uncharted worlds in the cut-and-paste bases. The enemy AI completely ignores any sort of cover system and just charges you, which is frustrating as fuck. You'll enter a room, start firing, and then the whole mob of 15 fucking guys just walks towards you, and you can't even put them down fast enough. You'll end up having to funnel everyone though the corridor you just came through very often. So the combat can seem weird as hell. During the campaign missions, this isn't a problem.  
  
* You're going to be collecting a bunch of shit that doesn't seem to do anything. Exo-skeleton armor addons, phasic rounds, etc, etc. I found the second biggest problem with ME1 is that most of the mods you pick up seem to have a negligable effect on combat, or their documentation is extremely unclear. I just stuck with anti-personel/shredder rounds for organic enemies, armor piercing/tungsten rounds for machines, and polonium rounds for Krogan, becuase they stop the Krogan from regenerating their health, and they're a bitch to put down.  
  
* Try to sell all your unused stuff to the Normandy's quartermaster each time you're there.

* Do not set the friendly squad AI to use their powers on their own. They'll waste so many opportunities.

* And depending on how much you get into the role playing, traversing barren worlds is cool as hell. There's no other game that lets me land on an empty rock, see an alien sunset, and hear creepy howling winds while I roll around in my retro 70's space rover. Sure, it was too cut-and-paste, but Bioware could have addressed that rather than strip it out completely for ME2. Now in ME2, there's a major loss in scale/epicness. Everything seems small and claustrophobic now. Same for elevators, now instead of squad chatter, we get loading screens, and we STILL have to wait either way.

Mass Effect 3,,,,ThanksICouldHelpBro,,,,,,,,t2_4h2ep,,,"I'd say just go through ME1 for the story and to get the world you want. The real fun is ME2. I don't blame you for bailing, ME1 starts slow.

My advice for ME1:

* Vanguard gets the fun of biotics and the powerful skills of soldiers. My fav class (note that ME2's classes are better balanced and you don't have to stick with what you chose in ME1)
* Always max out your charm/intimidate skill. Opens up more dialogue and plot options.
* When you're in a vehicle, don't stop moving. The quicker you get out of the Mako the happier you'll be, so just keep driving. Not worth the EXP.
* After every mission, try to initiate dialog with every character. They all have cool backstories.

My advice for ME2:

* Your first play through, do every mission, even loyalty missions for characters you don't like.
* All of the classes are balanced and playable and unique.
* Forget the hubbub about scanning for minerals. It's not that miserable, and it's fairly obvious which few upgrades can affect the plot.

On one hand I prefer classes and slight restrictions so that you become more powerful over time as said class but then again I like the option to play however I'd like with no class restrictions but this way it feels diluted and if you level one thing too high other options become unviable. Unless of course you grind to increase those too. Personally I wish games like Dragon Age with set classes allowed the user to test the classes in an arena type mode or ""test facility"" so you know before you even start the game which class you might be leaning towards.

Yes, it's a city builder at its core. Coming from the CiM franchise we're obviously going to implement very functional transportation options, but the game isn't ""CiM with some more building options"" in any way or form.

As for the districts question, it's a bit too detailed for me to give a clear reply on right now, but if you come over to our forums there are several developers from CO that will gladly answer.

Dead Cells,,,,WelcomeToDarktide,,,,,,,,,,,"I gotta say -- this game is awesome.

I'll admit. I pirated an old Alpha last night to play w/my friend, and was so impressed I bought the game today. That being said, I was on an ANCIENT build.

The NPCs models were different. The knight at the start wasn't there. Entire lines of dialogue were gone. Item level scaling was gone. The gold door cost 4k instead of 1k. There were more cursed chests and level bugs. No vine climbing/creating. The timed doors didn't have an hourglass. Your RT/LT items didn't flare when they came back, and you could only go to the ramparts.

Anyways -- this game is GREAT. I'm a fan of this style game, but something about games like Spelunky and Hollow Knight always felt lacking in some way. Ori and the Blind Forrest was incredible and this is such a great game too. I really hope the devs have success.

So, what's your experience with Persona, Brlghtslde? I'm fairly new to the series, P4Golden being my entry. I'm currently playing through Persona 3, though I've been taking it slowly.

After that I bought a PSP just to play P3P and, again, wowza! What a game. I've just finished watching Persona 4 the Animation (which was... *good*, I guess). The next game I'm hoping to get (once I plow through my backlog, Christ) is P2: Innocent Sin on the PSP. I'm a little apprehansive about getting it, though, with its gameplay being pretty outdated -- I'm hoping it'll hold up. And then, eventually, I want to get P4U. But Atlus have to get their shit together and release it in Europe first. -.-

(Also, I beat Catherine the other week. I'm pretty certain that's grounded in the Persona universe.)

Translated by Carol Brown Janeway (apparently -- and outrageously -- not from the Hungarian original but from the German translation. Hungarian title: A gyertyák csonkig égnek Embers is being made into a film, directed by Milos Forman and starring Sean Connery, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and Winona Ryder (presumably to be released in late 2004 or 2005) Not quite a consensus, but generally very enthusiastic
After his wife died, Márai retreated more and more into isolation. A literary master lays bare the essentials---what is truth, what are the questions we ask, what is the meaning of life itself---and lets them explode into action. My conclusion was that his books really do, by some strange alchemy, make one feel a better person. We acknowledge (and remind and warn you) that they may, in fact, be entirely unrepresentative of the actual reviews by any other measure. Reviews of notable books ahead of publication
One may not be able to tell a book by its cover, but the satin-textured jacket of Embers, with its haunting image of a 19th century noblewoman, is sure to seduce readers who might otherwise bypass a translation of an unknown 60-year-old novel. - Bella Stander, Wall Street Journal (An) expertly mitred narrative. (.) It is as masterly and lovely a novel as one could ask for (..) Embers is perfect.
In a castle at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, an old aristocrat waits to greet the friend he has not seen for forty-one years. - J.M.Coetzee, The New York Review of Books 3.9 of 5 stars 3.90 avg rating — 212 ratings — published 1935 — 19 editions Though the novel inevitably has an old-fashioned feel, the questions it raises are timeless.
Translation is, per se, almost inexcusable, but to translate from a translation is an unpardonable and offensive literary sin. It also might explain why this version reads as it does.) The incredible critical acclaim with which the book has been showered in country after country in Europe upon the rediscovery of Márai, as well as the popular success of the book (Embers was a bestseller in several countries) are somewhat mystifying. Perhaps -- probably, given that it is based on the German translation, not the original -- there are significant issues with the English translation (we haven t seen the translations in other languages, and the Hungarian original is unfortunately beyond us), but, while certainly a readable story, it is hardly an exceptional one.
Which makes it all the more of a pity that it has taken so long for him to be introduced to the English reader. Sorry, we just need to make sure you re not a robot.

Kingdom Hearts III,,,,StrayFellow,,,,,,,,t2_ripr8,,,"It's extremely complicated, but let me try to make it simple. 

If you want to understand Kingdom Hearts 3 then there are 2 games that you have to pick up. They are both available on Playstation 4. These games are *1.5+2.5 HD Remix* and *2.8*. You mentioned that you've tried *2.8* before, but I believe you might be confusing it with something else. So just double check that. Now, there is also a third game that's crucial to Kingdom Hearts 3, but it's a mobile game. You don't have to play it. If you just watch cutscenes on Youtube, like the majority of the fanbase, then you should be okay. It's called *Kingdom Hearts Unchained X*.

Dark Souls,,,,ChingShih,,,,,,,,t2_3y4wt,,,"Since the **TL;DR** didn’t fit above, here it is:

**TL;DR:** Dark Souls will have a very similar feel to Demon’s Souls, but expand on the freedom of the player to define their own strategy *as well as* how they work their way through the game. Particularly, players can choose their recovery points or communicate via Beacon Fire, an element not seen in Demon’s Souls.

**General Synopsis of Q&amp;A:**

- “... we intend to increase the difficulty ... by giving players the freedom to strategize freely and conquer that difficulty, and to be rewarded accordingly.”

- “Things that you lose in death can be outweighed by what you gain by trying again.”

- “In Dark Souls, we’ve added the ability to players to choose their recovery point — essentially respawn points.”

- “... we’ve added a lot of aspects that users must learn beyond the controls.” This will include magic, weapons, weapon attacks, and items.

- “... we want to improve the uniqueness of each weapon. Each weapon will have characteristics that are vastly different from other weapons in the game.”

- “Throughout the game, there will be both cooperative and competitive play with other players.”

- “Beacon Fire will be used to share experiences with other players. It’s a place where players can gather together and communicate — not verbally communicate, but emotionally communicate.”

- “... all the monsters I design — from Demon’s Souls to Dark Souls — are “beautiful” to me, no matter how gruesome their appearance.”",,,,,,,,0.0,,1296890618.0,1296865418,,,0.0,,c1fjdyr,,,t3_ffimc,,,t3_ffimc,,,3,False,,,darksouls,t5_2sazo,,,,,,,1268964101.0,1.0,1426742629.0,926.0,,,,,,,,

[laughter] The real Holy Sword, though, might be very hard to master despite its power. And some players will say, “This is difficult to use? Leave it to me, I’ll master it!” [laughter]. The mind games and strategizing — that’s the most fun aspect of the game to me.

**[#3:](http://i.imgur.com/z2WXs.jpg)** A replacement for Blue Eye Knights, or perhaps regular knights?

**[#4:](http://i.imgur.com/MZ2Dy.jpg)** I'd like a wall scroll of this. It reminds me of the fountain area in 1-3, Boletarian Palace with the swords looking like they fell out of the sky. Very crucifix-like.

**[#6:](http://i.imgur.com/DpNcc.jpg)** Incredibly bad-ass. I wonder where this guy lives. Maybe inside of the world depicted in the first picture?

**[#7:](http://i.imgur.com/yRbAp.jpg)** Wallpaper material.

**[#8:](http://i.imgur.com/ESFgG.jpg)** Definitely reminiscent of the Flamelurker. Loving this picture, but I wish it were better quality.

Now that I think about it, it *will* be full of RPG elements, such as combining objects to make something new. I believe I read somewhere where if she wants to build something, but doesn't have the correct herb (say) then she will to go out and search for it. That's RPG all the way.

In other words, this new game isn't really a prequel. It just throws out the whole canon because none of the other games, which supposedly happen in her future, make sense otherwise.

It's a completely new game. I think they just used the ""Lara Croft"" name to gain some traction. I hope it's a success but unless they keep enough of the traditional aspects of TR it might alienate a lot of the fans. On the other hand, TR has a ton of female fans and this new RPG styling might really appeal to them.

Yeah, like you said, ""they totally killed tomb raider here and only thing left is lara that can remind us of that good old times."" Time will tell. It's still a long way off. I can't wait to start submitting some ""Let's Play""s and get some reactions to the game.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1313606450.0,1313581250,,,0.0,,c2d37ab,,,t3_jlg4a,,,t3_jlg4a,,,2,False,,,TombRaider,t5_2sk5x,,,,,,,1283043709.0,1.0,1427482482.0,6703.0,,,,,,,,
Shadow of the Tomb Raider,,,,Tonkarz,,,,,,,,t2_4xurg,,,"The old Tomb Raider games were good for the time. When Tomb Raider came out, it did a lot of things that no other game had done. But it sucked in a lot of ways. Moving Lara around was difficult and infamously awkward, combat was a boring chore and the levels were all blocky and ugly.

All of the old Tomb Raider games suffered from these issues. Angel of Darkness may have dropped the blocky levels, but it still suffered from the other two problems (and there were many other issues with the game, mostly related to how it was barely out of Alpha on release i.e. totally and completely unfinished; a buggy mess).

Legend, Anniversary and Underworld did have shorter levels, but this is beside the point. What really matters is that the games were shorter overall. The puzzles were easier too. Part of this was because Lara was far easier to control, but it is mostly due to how expensive and difficult games are to make these days. But long levels, hard puzzles or an open world were not the things that made Tomb Raider fun, interesting or entertaining. What made the old Tomb Raider games entertaining was exploring and navigating the environments.

The three Crystal Dynamics games improved on this a lot. Lara can do a lot more stuff in this regard, not to mention her grappling hook. They also made Lara easier to move and fight with. They put it stuff to find around the levels, and improved the camera and environments. They are better games overall. 

The newest Tomb Raider game appears to have some RPG elements (like AoD was supposed to have). Certainly not loaded with them (unless they start talking about ability scores and skill points), but it does have some. But why is this a bad thing? If it works, it will be a lot of fun. 

For the most part, this RPG elements will mean the game will have exactly the type of content you lamented as being missing from the newer Tomb Raider games. Only instead of hunting down an arbitrary item (some key that is, for some reason, lying around in a room on the other side of the level) you hunt down a specific item so you can make something that improves Lara's abilities in some significant way. Not to mention that you will be doing so in the context of an open world.

As far as Lara being inexperienced, this game is about how she becomes the experienced and capable Tomb Raider we all know. She might start out weak but she'll get better over the course of the game until she is an ass kicking heroine worthy of the Lara Croft name. 

Of course, this is just theory. The game isn't out yet, so it could suck mightily, but don't give up on it so soon. Everything we've seen suggests that it'll be pretty good, if not one of the best games next year.

tl;dr Old Tomb Raider games suck, new Tomb Raider games good, play new Tomb Raider before deciding it sucks.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1313616872.0,1313591672,,,0.0,,c2d42al,,,t3_jlg4a,,,t3_jlg4a,,,1,False,,,TombRaider,t5_2sk5x,,,,,,,1299675702.0,1.0,1427482876.0,17125.0,,,,,,,,
Shadow of the Tomb Raider,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed both ""eras"" for what they were: action-adventure and puzzle games starring a tall, big-breasted English woman who had a sexy voice, wore skimpy clothing, and kicked some serious ass.

Now having said that, I appreciate the backstory that the developers have cultivated and the humanizing elements that have been introduced these last few games. However, the Tomb Raider canon has always been a bit of a mess. Rebooting this franchise is the right thing to do. Clarify her backstory, give her generous but believable proportions, and show us how she became this sexy, driven, and adventurous woman that will risk her life for ancient artifacts.

Just because this new story focuses on the survival elements of her original adventure doesn't mean that the aspects we've grown to love will be absent in the future. Perhaps this experience of torture makes her say ""Screw it: I'm going to do this for fun and wear a teal tank-top and short-shorts while wielding pistols, just because I want to.""

Those games were similar to TR and raised my expectations for the action genre.  The Uncharted series has changed how people look at action games and to keep up, TR has to make some changes.  So in order to keep Lara alive, TR had to undergo some innovations to keep up with Uncharted.  I'm looking forward to the changes simply because I love both Uncharted and TR, they are both great series.  Mostly, I'm looking forward to the open island aspect.

Shadow of the Tomb Raider,,,,kimmitanto,,,,,,,,t2_3k3tb,,,"I know its a late reply, but still, here's an explaination from Karl Stewart from Crystal Dynamics:

&gt;The poster using Underworld Lara isn’t indicative of a long-term partnership with McDonalds. McDonalds was looking to put together a campaign featuring iconic characters, and asked if we’d allow them to include Lara alongside other pop-culture personas as Darth Vadar, King Kong, and even the dude from Scream. It made sense to use a more traditional version of Lara instead of the less-identifiable and younger version. I think the campaign is actually drawing to a close, so I’m not sure they will be around much longer.

However, my dream is finding a way out of a repetitive life, while the video discusses a way to merely cope with what you already have and merge the idea of work and play together. 
He said we should consider everything as a light game so we'll still be full of energy after all the work is done. But at some jobs you can't risk taking things lightly or perceiving it as a game. Nothing about work is enjoyable or pleasant. To view it as a game is, in my opinion, just making the best out of a bad case scenario. 
It's as if someone told me ""Yeah, you're in hell and it's really hot here, but pretend you're ice skating in Alaska and the thought of it might keep you cool.""
It's merely a band-aid on a broken arm. 
And I'm not shooting your opinion down or anything, I promise. But I'm expressing my open and honest thoughts on how I perceive things. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1468447546.0,1468422346,,,0.0,,d5an9q4,,,t3_4sljhn,,,t1_d5af6kk,,,2,,,False,AWayOut,t5_3fdmg,,,,,,,1422668176.0,2.0,1471400901.0,15006.0,,,,,,,,
A Way Out,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,"I know the point is hard to get. If you follow Alan Watt's teachings (which can be long, I know), you will see that in his perspective, all life is a game. 

Think ""game"" more like ""role"". Everyone has roles, and each role has its responsibilities. We can take a role (by becoming a parent for example), or get can leave it behind (leaving home, so you aren't a child anymore). What he is saying is more like chose a role that suits you, where you can feel fulfilled. If you don't want to be dependant un hierarchy, don't be an employee, go independent. If you don't want the hassle if having kids, simply don't!

He's not saying roles don't have responsibilities. Take the head of a big company, this guy has the big responsibility of all the salaries of his employees. But if he takes pleasure in what he's doing, he will feel like he is having the time of his life his whole career! But he will still be responsable for all employees.

He is not saying ""Stay where you are and enjoy it"" either. Rather, find where you really want to be. It can be where you already are, it could be somewhere else. Find not where your parents want you to be. Not what your University teacher wants, nor your ex-girlfriend. Find where do you want to be, really, deep down in your heart. And why are you not making a step right now to do exactly that?

You could also see it another way. Imagine you are in your old days, looking back at where you are exactly now. You are about to die, so really, nothing matters anymore, you can feel that you could go outside naked screaming, it won't matter. What was your goal at that time? Should you have changed in order to obtain what you wanted?

You could also watch ""The Truman show"". If you truly understands what it's about, you'll find all your answers there :)

Nioh,,,,ALCxKensei,,,,,,,,t2_6jpiw,,,"That sounds pretty cool. I was thinking maybe one stance emphasizes stronger attacks, another faster attacks, another maybe defense, and perhaps another counter attacking or something. Just a guess. The stances for different attack combos sounds very similar to the Kengo games. Have you played them? During fights you were able to switch between different stances to perform different combinations of sword slashes. In the first game you could actually create your own sword slash combos for a stance by choosing the individual sword slashes.  It was one of my favorite PS2 games.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFsrEu1kEN8 ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1459886438.0,1459861238,,,0.0,,d1qm3lw,,,t3_48a0nq,,,t1_d1qlmzx,,,1,,,False,Nioh,t5_39y47,,,,,,,1325275087.0,5.0,1463231702.0,919.0,,,,1459861461.0,,,,

Nioh,,,,MrHuk,,,,,,,,t2_5u09v,,,"I just killed the boss so here are my thoughts:

. I love how they give you the option to switch between 900p/60fps and 1080p/30fps, I played using the former and while it very rarely actually hit the 60fps target (especially once you get to the second area) I do really appreciate them adding it, it's the first time I've seen it on console. Hopefully by release it'll be a solid 60fps.

. I hate the durability mechanic, it's far too harsh, you'll realise this once you get to the boss and your gear starts to constantly break during tries and you run out of items to repair your gear. This has to change before release IMO.

. Combat is good, decapitations are brutal and satisfying. I liked the selection of weapons and they all offer something unique, there's a lot of depth to the weapon and skill system.

. The game is HARD, like really, really hard. If you're expecting it to be as hard as Dark Souls think again, it's much harder.

. Load times are almost non existent when you die, I was super impressed by this.

Overall it's good, I'm not sure if I'll grab it at launch but I can see myself buying it at some point, I will definitely keep an eye on it and I hope they do a beta.

They include all of the previous classes (Adept, Soldier, etc) and also add a new seventh one called ""Explorer"" for those using Tech+Biotic+Combat powers. Each one also provides an active power.

It seems like you unlock and level profiles by investing in the corresponding powers. So, if you only invest in Biotic powers you will unlock the Adept profile. If you invest in Biotic + Combat powers then you unlock the Vanguard profile.

It reminds me most closely of Kingdoms of Amalur ""Destiny Cards"" which functioned as classes unlocked also by investment.

I don't need free placement of decorations but I enjoy the fact that park guests appreciate even the smallest of effort I put into the park.

I would love to have to deal with the politics that could come with owning a dinosaur park. Maybe you have to balance PR and lobbying. Maybe some laws keep you from making certain aggressive dinosaurs. Perhaps certain organizations will call for a ban on your park because it's abuse! I don't know. Perhaps that'd be too gimmicky.

I'd love to mix and match dinosaurs like they did in the recently shit movie (my opinion). Certain dinosaurs would be easier to handle and draw more guests after putting in time to create them. 

I would love to have to deal with all the nitty gritty and behind the scenes stuff. You make the park beautiful, but you need to have tunnels and power stations and roads to quickly move staff around the park. A power outage should be detrimental if your staff can't safely reach the station. Striking a balance between bringing guests in and ensuring that dinosaurs don't eat said guests.

It'd be fun if there was some crazy mini game where you had to shoot or tranquilize your dinosaurs and retake the park (if you critically fail).

This is a fantastic guide to the bosses, with recommended level ranges, strategies, Personas, personal notes and the strengths and weaknesses of every boss.

Some of it is different for Persona 4 (for instance the Nice Guy and Tough Guy have weaknesses in P4G while they do not in P4) but you already beat that part, so you're all set.

Use CTRL+F to find what you're looking for, if you are afraid of spoilers.

Hollow Knight,,,,FFFFFF_Hat,,cornifer,,,,,,t2_kpdzs,,,"I just recently finished getting through what I believe is every nook and cranny of the beta.  Overall, it is an excellent game and I literally cannot wait for the full release.  That being said, I'd like to list what I really enjoyed, what I'd like to see different, and then compare how far I was able to get.

1: What I Love

* The map is just a plain, hand-drawn map; there are no &lt;go there&gt;s or &lt;you are here&gt;s

* You can't see enemy hit points.  I feel it just adds a nice level of uncertainty to the boss fights, and I actually noticed at least on the mini boss guys, they kinda get ""sweaty"" as they get weaker.

* Your hand isn't held; they don't explain that you should be heading in this direction, this ability can do this, [spoiler](/s ""you can down attack spikes to jump on them""), or even little things like [spoiler](/s ""ringing the stag station bell"") that took me longer than I care to admit...

2: What I'd Like to See

* First off, I don't have a controller and for a metroidvania-esque with movement limited to four direction I'd like to stick to my keyboard; so, I'd like to see rebindable keys, otherwise I'll just make a new key layout profile (yay expensive keyboards!)

* Slightly going off the previous thought, I think a very worthwhile addition would be mapping attack to four directions,  i.e. move with arrows and attack with wasd.  I'm not even sure that I'd like this, but I think it would make midair attacks easier.

* I hope that people agree with me on this on.  I'd like to see the final game made harder!, but not just by raising the hp of enemies.  The example that I thought of during my gameplay was to make the charging beetles with the horns invincible from the front, that would force you to either jump over and attack from behind or attack from above.  Of course, I'm sure that there will be more difficult enemies in other areas but, I'd love for this game to be a serious challenge.

3: What I Could Find / What I Could Never Get To

(Please note this entire section will spoil my entire ""end-game"" findings)

* [spoiler](/s ""I found the old knight, who returns to the surface, the shopkeeper who can never finish setting up shop, the stag station ""passenger-ant?""."")

* [spoiler](/s ""I rescued all of the worms in jars, although there was one where I sliced the jar open through the floor by up attacking... not sure if that is the intended way to free him, I did try the vengeful spirit ability tho and it didn't work."")

* [spoiler](/s ""I only unlocked one ability, the vengeful spirit, and only managed to obtain 3 of the 4 ""mask?"" pieces, the lowest one, in the room with the piston worms, I could not get."")

* [spoiler](/s ""I never found a pass for the trolley thing, and never accessed the elevator at the bottom of the map, oh and I never got to the building on the cliff in the same area as the shopkeeper's hut."")

Let me know what you guys think about the game, do you agree with my suggestions, disagree with them?  Why?
I can't wait to play the full game!

1. It's super shiny and smooth looking, I get if it's a new suit maybe it would be freshly polished, but it would quickly accumulate some scuff marks as you go.
2. The head and upper torso sections just stand out SUPER bad against the other colours. They should just make the head and torso match the rest of the colour scheme.
3. This is by far the most sexualized version of the suit. It looks like it could be skin tight, as if she has large hips and is super curvy, which is just gross to me.

&gt;King Knight isn’t a king, he is a king-themed knight. But that doesn’t stop him from making decrees! As the lord defender of Pridemoor Keep, he commands a formidable army of minions. Experienced with repelling invaders who dare try topple his malevolent monarchy, King Knight is a master of single combat. And because he’s dressed to the nines at almost all times, he’s always ready for a brutal coronation!

&gt;Pros: Commanding presence, charismatic, snappy dresser

&gt;Cons: Not actually a king

Personally, I hope you're right and they stay dedicated to the game for years, continually giving us new content in small chunks as opposed to just one or two big DLCs @ $15 apiece.

The current issue with portability is that different compilers and even different cpu's can do things that cause slightly different results on floating point operations because of their limited precision, and the slightest difference in player speed or position can turn in to a huge difference a few seconds later and the replay may end up with dustman running back and forth in the wrong place, occasionally attacking the wall.

We haven't had any issues with the PC version yet, but I'd like to avoid having to separate replays between platforms.

Also, having gotten an S+ in the prototype level ""Difficult"" and having gotten every achievement in SMB, I can say that if they are telling the truth about SMB levels and Difficult being easy compared to levels in the final build, then this game will have some of the hardest levels in any game that isn't a shmup.

&gt;Q: Will there be mac/linux support?
&gt;
&gt;A: I’d love to support more platforms, but I can’t promise anything. **I wrote the code to make this easy, but system interfaces (disc i/o, input, graphics, etc) need implementations per platform.** I’m just one guy, so my first priority is to get the game finished. If the game does well I have ideas for expansions, and I could probably be convinced to extend the engine for multi-platform support. I know that no one likes a later release date for their platform of choice. Sorry.
&gt;
&gt;Q: What engine did you use to make this game?
&gt;
&gt;A: None, it’s my own engine written from scratch using C++.

C++ Disk I/O and keyboard input are the same for all three platforms.  OpenGL is also cross platform.

The fact you're writing this from scratch using MS APIs and DirectX shows you had no intention of releasing it on the Linux and/or Mac.

I wish you luck, you've obviously got major talent.  I just wish more people realized OpenGL is just as good as, if not better than, DirectX and makes it easier to port over.",,,,,,,,1.0,,1364015189.0,1363989989,,,0.0,,c90nxxh,,,t3_1at6p5,,,t3_1at6p5,,,-3,False,,,Banished,t5_2wp64,,,,,,,1282785222.0,1.0,1431672629.0,16035.0,,,,,,,,

I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say here.  From what I understand, the author started from scratch, sans game engine.  If he started with OpenGL, there would be nothing to port.  A pure OpenGL C++ program should need nothing other than a recompile to ""port over"" to a supported OS.

I'm not a big gamer but I do enjoy the occasional game.  I do have a few Windows games, but I'm playing them less and less.  I'm looking for more native games to fill my need, and they're getting easier and easier to find.  I have no doubt this game will do well, I'm just saying if the developer were really concerned with multi platform, he should've worked that out in the initial planing stage.  This far into the game, it's too late for an easy port, and I highly doubt one man will be able to do it on his own.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1364024377.0,1363999177,,,0.0,,c90pz7s,,,t3_1at6p5,,,t1_c90osb6,,,1,False,,,Banished,t5_2wp64,,,,,,,1282785222.0,3.0,1431673588.0,4492.0,,,,,,,,

It's refreshing, the music is spot on from what we heard and violent tones in the game take a back seat.  I wouldn't mind seeing combat, but in a minor role against bandits or something.  Nothing major.

It seemed to use the heating / AC vents to get around the ship quickly, and while I didn't notice any ceiling crawling in the demo, it certainly was either crawling or walking around. When the demo started, a small tutorial played saying the Alien could SEE us and HEAR us...so we were encouraged not to run (because you'd die immediately) and to only use our flashlights when we absolutely knew the Alien had no line of sight with us. (Small note: the flashlight has 2 settings, wide and open or small and focused - which can be togged using the right D-pad). Playing just in the 30 minutes I had (and being extremely careful) I'd say I died about six times and 4 of those times made me jump.

Alien: Isolation,,,,Valo118,,,,,,,,t2_4q0af,,,"Honestly, the controls felt a bit odd. I dont remember what was bound to what exactly but I just remember the crouch, melee and run buttons being not where you'd expect them. The strange controls are certainly what got me killed once. Regardless, I'm sure they'll be customizable so it's not a big concern.

The graphics looked great. They've really nailed the atmosphere of the original Alien films right down to the stitching on clothing, the keyboards, the mugs, cables...white padded walls. It all feels incredibly authentic and ontop of it all is a very retro, grimy feeling VHS filter (which is applied during tutorials, cinematics etc) and that effect is my favorite look of the game.

I was playing on a PS4 with a Turtle Rock headset. The graphics looked great but the FPS was a bit of a concern. It felt like it was mostly 30fps but whenever I looked at something that had alot of particles and lighting effects (like water leaking into space from the ship I was currently on - through the windows) the game seemed to get a bit choppy...maybe around 15 or 20fps. No way of knowing exactly but it didn't feel as smooth as it should have. I **was** told however that this was an extremely old alpha build from back in January and that everything should be smoothed out by the time of release.

Sound design I cant comment on too much because the volume of the headset was too low. I wasn't able to adjust it....but from what I could hear, it sounded great! The ship felt incredibly heavy...I could hear the chugging base of the engines, the hiss of doors when they opened, the bony clacks of the aliens tail dragging on the metal floor....the positional audio work sounded good and whatever SFX they're using for the Alien running at you is TERRIFYING. Made my heart pound and my eyes wince right as the Aliens tail slammed through my chest, bringing me to a death screen so I could retry from my last checkpoint.

I have 0 CSS experience, so this has been a real learning experience. I made the banner, and I whitened out the background, added steering wheel votes,vote colors, custom traffic light mail icons(red=none, green=mail), spoiler code,user flair(still in progress) custom tab colors, transparency on the sidebar(looks better) and a few other odds and ends. If you have any suggestions let me know what you think.

I still have a few things and mysteries to solve, But I am now finally feeling proud of my sub launch and hope everyone enjoys it.

*6/13 Added more flair, traffic light colored votes, changed the title bar graphics slightly, made some custom stuff for the sidebar, made a custom icon for self posts, and fixed up a few broken things.

I put about 3 days into this so far. I was like a deer in headlights Monday night after seeing Ubisoft's press conference seeing how basic subs start. But after studying the default CSS code, mixed with lots of trial and error,designing quick graphics and reading CSS self help stuff I got it working. I guess anything is possible when you put your mind into it.

Thanks for coming, and look forward to great discussions down the road.

The other thing mentioned that was interesting is, There is only 20 hours of story but there are over 1 thousand 20 second challenges.(which may mean stunts and jumps) That's pretty awesome. There will be lot's of multiplayer action as well so the 20 hour gameplay isn't a major deal.

&gt;**Game play feels a lot like a mix between a very well done arcade style racer, and a mission-based title like Grand Theft Auto.** Cars and trucks are constructed for different styles of driving and terrain, and goals are presented as you progress. We built ourselves an off-road-ready **Ford Focus ST** in our demo mission, and were asked to ""take down"" some joker driving through Miami in a crazily tuned **Hummer H2**. The cityscape, roads and beaches around this virtual Miami were completely open to drive over and through, with **jumps, flips and crashes resulting from too much speed** and too little care on unstable bits. It's a riot, with car handling more subtle than GTA and less detailed than any of the big racing sims.

However, I read somewhere that the story ""is as good, if not better than symphonia"". Whoever said that was dead wrong lol. Still good but a lot of dungeon nonsense in between was kinda keeping me from really enjoying it. Especially the one you go back to like 5 times that's basically symmetrical and suuuper easy to get lost in. 

I know I sound like I don't like it, but the uninspired music and god awful dungeon design are really the only missteps in the whole game. Otherwise, it's quite good.

I can't remember the demon dual-sword guys name but him and Reaper's conversations were the only real treats for me. If the game was about him instead of violet I would've liked it more. The humor and VA are top notch but the story's thrill was driven entirely by information being withheld from you and veryyy slowly at that, while Symphonia or Legendia had a lot revealed to you from the get-go and the thrill came from actually significant plot twists. The only plot twist in Berseria is quite disappointing and I saw it coming after the first hour of the game. 

Plus the dungeon layout and design were atrocious. Easily the weakest part of this game. A close 2nd being the lackluster and uninspired music.

Tales of Berseria,,,,ElijahDaniel,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Yeas I have. I found this story had a few more applicable life lesson. I like moralistic stories. 
2. Rokuro Rangetsu and Eizen, no surname, and yeah they're pretty great. 
3. Her name is Velvet, and I personally found that she is one of very few, traumatized protagonists done right. I especially appreciate what I see as a constant quite resistance to her darker emotions, and growing the character through it, as well as endearing her. She still knows how to smile and joke, and wants to be the person she was before.
4.I have no problem with the information being withheld, because, it was done well and, for me, created a connection to characters like Eleanor. Where once it was pointed out to me that things were not as I was told, I could think back and see the rules never changed. There was for instance, no moment where Malak's did not have free will. I just like her, believed what I was told the first time and didn't pay attention when that rule was contradicted. As an aside this it's also important set dressing, as the information you start with and what you discover and what you start out believing is what allows you to empathize with the npcs who are blind to the world they live in. A kind of Trueman Show experience from my perspective.
5.I don't think the plot twist was supposed to surprise the player, what was supposed to entertain about it, was watching what it did to the characters.
6. I can't think of a single tales game that didn't have awful dungeons, run here push the button or the block, use the mcguffin to throw a slightly different colored switch. It's always been this way. I also felt the music was exceptional. After all, originality in itself isn't a positive, nor are tropes cliches or classics a negative. It's all in the execution, which I found were perfectly in line with the themes.
7. The heartless thing was of course meant as a joke. Just to express the apparently immense disparity between you and me.

Control,,,,tsunderekatsu,,,[],,,,text,t2_1spys31,,,"Wow, am I really the first one here?

Okay, I'm going to talk Control then. A lot of people were somewhat disappointed that this game isn't Alan Wake 2, but I think they're actually heavily related. Ironically, the clue that really indicates this for me comes from the chalkboard in Quantum Break which talks about AWEs - ""Alan Wake Experiences,"" or ""Altered World Events."" In Control's gameplay footage, the ""objects of power"" are said to be capable of triggering AWEs, which could be reality shifts similar to those that Alan talked about in Alan Wake's American Nightmare.

Control is about an SCP Foundation-like government agency who are in charge of ""controlling"" what Sam Lake calls ""the unexplainable,"" which in this case is the supernatural. Throughout Quantum Break I saw hints that Monarch Solutions' wide-scale analysis of the butterfly effect took note of many instances of ""narrative deviation"" or something like that wherein Alan Wake or objects of power cause changes in the nature of reality. As such, I think Alan Wake is related to and possibly exists within the lore of Control.

I think they're two sides of the same coin, Alan Wake and Control, with Alan Wake having had one ""experience of the unexplainable,"" whereas Control takes on a whole lot more (including deviant refrigerators).",,True,,,,,,0.0,,1529562075.0,1529536875,,,0.0,,e10patq,,False,t3_8s329c,,True,t3_8s329c,/r/controlgame/comments/8s329c/speculation_megathread/e10patq/,,5,False,True,False,controlgame,t5_kbrr3,,public,,,,,1517930418.0,1.0,1532763083.0,180971.0,,,,,,markdown,,

I've read a lot of ""House of Leaves"" (because ""Alan Wake"" was also inspired by it), but not all of it since that book is a postmodern avant-garde monster. However, I could immediately see the influence it had on Control: the ever-shifting, seemingly infinite interior of the Oldest House is reminiscent of the house on Ash Tree Lane in ""House of Leaves,"" which also has infinite interior hallways that shift constantly.

The SCP Foundation influence is also obvious: in the gameplay trailer there are ""altered objects"" kept in special containment cells for study, each of which have unique supernatural qualities. This is the central premise of the SCP wiki.

You have to work with the car to make it do what you want, it isn't one of those simple driving games. That factor makes it really satisfying when you perform well, even doing a nice power slide around a corner makes you feel accomplished.

I really like it so far. The story / voices / characters are so-so, the online play is quite a bit choppy, but overall it's worth playing. The cars look fantastic and the world is huge.

Yuri our logic is that nobody owns a wii u therefor no one will buy it. Okay. Than no one owns an ouya thwrefor no one will play spell tower or gunshadow. No one owns a game.com so no one will play resident evil 2 on it. No one owns an atari therefor nobody can play halo 2600.

Streetpass doesn't seem to be so important afterall because as soon as I got them I could beat all the remaining bosses pretty easily. (man is the ninja ability op in this game .. O.O)

So it may be useful to upgrade your knight, white mage and black mage so your friends (if they use your character as an abilink) have an easier start once they start with the game. I think this may be a hint that you have to unlock some of the jobs you had acces to in the demo.

btw: He also said that you will unlock the remaining jobs in sidequest in the fullgame, which may be quite interesting. I'm already looking forward to play it. :)",,,,,,,,0.0,,1384639772.0,1384614572,,,0.0,,cdfogmn,,,t3_1qmtcr,,,t1_cdfo8b9,,,3,False,,,bravelydefault,t5_2u1oz,,,,,,,1356329187.0,2.0,1428637025.0,971.0,,,,,,,,

Since its downloaded it doesn't come with the AR card however, which is kinda sad because the opening movie asks you to use it, you can still watch it without and the console just approximates where things should be for you.

I'm 20 minutes into it so far (download took FOREVER!) after purchasing it at 1am UK time (2am my time), and there goes my weekend and probably most of Christmas.

A little on the features for anyone interested:

Audio Language can be Japanese or English
(Great for someone like me who didn't quite like the English voice acting for some characters).

Text language is great, you can pick from every language the games being sold in, including Japanese, which for someone like me is great as I can catch up on my Kanji before i head to Japan by doing a Japanese only run on my 2nd playthrough.

Other:
You don't unlock the brave/default moves at the very beginning, those are unlocked in an event, and you can't purchase magic at a store until you've unlocked the white or black mage jobs.

* You need to buy spells from the store in town, much like older Final Fantasy games.

* You can cross equip skills between jobs, for example; I have a Performer, with Valkyrie commands as my secondary action, with the ""two handed"" skill from Knight equipped.

* There is a lot of mixing and matching with the jobs, I would recommend maxing all jobs in the demo so you can tailor your party to your liking. Don't be afraid to experiment!

* I leveled Tiz and Edea to level 4 Performers, for the atk and def bonus at the end of each round, then Knight to level 2 for the two hand skill, and valkyrie to level 2 for crescent moon. (Allows you to hit all enemies with a two handed weapon, which is nice). Then whatever job I leveled, I was able to have the Performers passive, Knights 2 hand skill and the valkyries slash all attack.  Not saying this is the best way to go, but as an example.

I was thinking maybe one stance emphasizes stronger attacks, another faster attacks, another maybe defense, and perhaps another counter attacking or something. Just a guess. The stances for different attack combos sounds very similar to the Kengo games. Have you played them? During fights you were able to switch between different stances to perform different combinations of sword slashes. In the first game you could actually create your own sword slash combos for a stance by choosing the individual sword slashes.

Nioh 2,,,,MrHuk,,,,,,,,t2_5u09v,,,"I just killed the boss so here are my thoughts:

. I love how they give you the option to switch between 900p/60fps and 1080p/30fps, I played using the former and while it very rarely actually hit the 60fps target (especially once you get to the second area) I do really appreciate them adding it, it's the first time I've seen it on console. Hopefully by release it'll be a solid 60fps.

. I hate the durability mechanic, it's far too harsh, you'll realise this once you get to the boss and your gear starts to constantly break during tries and you run out of items to repair your gear. This has to change before release IMO.

. Combat is good, decapitations are brutal and satisfying. I liked the selection of weapons and they all offer something unique, there's a lot of depth to the weapon and skill system.

. The game is HARD, like really, really hard. If you're expecting it to be as hard as Dark Souls think again, it's much harder.

. Load times are almost non existent when you die, I was super impressed by this.

Overall it's good, I'm not sure if I'll grab it at launch but I can see myself buying it at some point, I will definitely keep an eye on it and I hope they do a beta.

The number of missions was much shorter and just filled with missions that had no jet fighting that wasn't interuppted by mid-game cutscenes or mandatory DFM tours with invincible targets, or really shitty landing missions.  I NEVER ONCE GOT TO LAND MY PLANE WITHOUT IT BEING DAMAGED for the entire game.  I couldn't even bomb ground targets without entering an on rails system.  I just had no control over anything anymore.  And if your going to do that then fine, but put some traditional missions in there, throw in a TUNNEL MISSION that's been the standard since forever--not a bullet time event.  That's completely ridiculous. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1318760326.0,1318735126,,,0.0,,c2ru7ta,,,t3_lcrl0,,,t1_c2rrx82,,,1,False,,,acecombat,t5_2svt4,,,,,,,1317139394.0,4.0,1427737786.0,19766.0,,,,,,,,
Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation,,,,cb43569,,,,,,,,t2_4023u,,,"I've barely played any of the past Ace Combat games, but I enjoyed Assault Horizon. From my perspective, it was actually a good game. I enjoyed how cinematic it was, and I liked the aeorplane combat sections; the helicopter controls were iffy, and some of the later missions seemed unbalanced in the distance between checkpoints and the difficulty of some small segments, but I still enjoyed the single-player campaign and I still take it online for Capital Conquest and Deathmatch every so often, even though I've yet to find a co-op partner.

As I understand it, Assault Horizon is not intended to be a sequel to the previous games, so I would personally try to approach it without feeling the need to compare it to its predecessors. By itself, it's not a *bad* game, wouldn't you agree? Plus, I've never had issue with cutscenes in the middle of dogfights - it's always thrown me back into the dogfight where I was when the cutscene was over.

Since you've beat the game already, I suppose there's no real loss in returning it, but I'm disappointed that you didn't enjoy it as much as I did.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1318811772.0,1318786572,,,0.0,,c2ry9o8,,,t3_lcrl0,,,t3_lcrl0,,,1,False,,,acecombat,t5_2svt4,,,,,,,1271298031.0,1.0,1427739764.0,141201.0,,,,,,,,
Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation,,,,skaijo,,,,,,,,t2_5xn3r,,,"I'm glad newcomers can be introduced to the series with this game.  And if your a fan of strong storylines, I strongly suggest you check out other titles AC has to offer (especially AC5).  The additional features for AC:AH are great and I'd love to see them in future titles, but the implementation of them had some profound flaws (invincible enemy planes you can't shoot down unless you engage DFM, DFM enemies that remain invulnerable until the dev's feel you're done taking their sight-seeing tour, quick-timey event HUD incidators: such as bumpers for CM, missle target charges during DFM, trying to line up triangles when being slowed down, etc.)  I can go on--those things slightly cheapen the experience bit by bit until you feel, if you've played previous games, that they're more getting in the way that just a new optional tool in your bag.  There's also a lack of series staples that have made AC what it is such as tunnel missions and giantweapon destruction missions that I'm sure you would have enjoyed if they included them into AC:AH.  They also removed briefing missions which were bumpers inbetween cutscenes and the actual misison itself that really helped to develop the story and give a better understanding of the complete significance of the mission at hand.  In AC:AH, it literally goes from:

Helicopter mission &gt; Cutscene ""He spoke Russian!"" &gt; Cutscene ""General the pilot heard someone speak Russian--let's bomb their base!"" &gt; Cutscene Woman: ""Here's a plane we can use to bomb them!"" &gt; Gameplay of you in a bomber

In previous games, if not set up diligently by customized story-based interviews like in AC0, you'll get Cutscene ""Your character's squad decided to shift their focus on Enemy X"" &gt; Briefing ""Enemy X is a very significant target, so this mission will consist of these three tactical units, you'll fly in at 1500 and must stay below that alt. until crossing this very specific point, afterwards, you'll have the choice to inflict damage at either of these two specific points"" &gt; Player toggles between which mission he wants to take &gt; Player chooses aircraft for entire squadron &gt; Gameplay Cutscene where Player gets plan prepped for take off &gt; Player takes off in plane &gt; Mission Start

^Based on that alone, I hope you can understand why I'm disappointed in AC:AH and why I recommend games like AC5 and AC0. 

Also, what story there is contains poignant plot holes (why would Illich incriminate Russians if he was secretly working for them the entire time?) and lacks motivation (what motivated Markov to blow up millions of people with Trinity BEFORE his girlfriend died, which clearly occured after Illich defected?) by its cast of antagonists.  *SIGH.

Also, no AC made me feel as alone as I had when playing AC:AH.  I literally spoke with Warwolf 3 and 4 once for the entire campaign despite flying with the the entire time--and they weren't even named.  Yet I know about Jack who was the co-pilot of the helicopter missions despite only being in a heli twice for the entire campaign.   

TL:DN, My faults with AC:AH are hardly mechanical.  I think there's great features that have been added that newcomers will enjoy.  But my issues are entirely based on the substance of what's left after you remove those features, and how rigidly those same features were implemented.  If this brings in new fans, then that's great (probably what was even intended), and I hope you look backwards down the line to find what's really the best in the series.

***Also, there's no point in shooting anything that isn't TGT in AC:AH to move to the next checkpoint.  Whereas in AC5 and AC0, you could assign teammates to take down green targets so that you could focus on TGTs and the combined scores would convert to points that you could utilize to purchase planes and even special-design aircrafts from an in-game store/hangar--and not be forced to buy in the form of DLC.  Which system sounds like the better game to you?  Not to continually compare, but when you have that experience coming into AC:AH, there's absolutely no argument as to which is superior and came out with more thought.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1318817719.0,1318792519,,,0.0,,c2rz18o,,,t3_lcrl0,,,t1_c2ry9o8,,,2,False,,,acecombat,t5_2svt4,,,,,,,1317139394.0,2.0,1427740124.0,5947.0,,,,,,,,

With this layout you have easy access to supers (A+B+K), A and B throw, various combination moves like A+B, A+K, B+K  and IMO the 8wr system makes more sense on stick.

Dragon's Dogma,,,,Aprahamian,,,,,,,,t2_4cgs9,,,"There are two streams of it out. They total about 4 hours and give a ton of info. Plus the Official Xbox Magazine youtube channel is putting out a bunch of videos hyping it better than Capcom is.

Here is the [First one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOgchg-az9k), [Second one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YimwPf0Fr3A).

Here are the Xbox Magazine videos. [Preview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrCiV4LOYk4), [Pawns](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEsVmmXQqWA&amp;list=UUYHAbfPRcXk_IVBoIM7pKMQ&amp;index=2&amp;feature=plcp), [Classes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c8krHCKHDI&amp;list=UUYHAbfPRcXk_IVBoIM7pKMQ&amp;index=3&amp;feature=plcp).

I have fallen in love with this game with watching all of these. This game is on a totally different level than Skyrim and other past RPG's. The co-op is perfect with it being all through Pawns. I am not a big fan of online co-op. I like couch co-op or no co-op. 

The amount of info in those videos are amazing. It would take 4 in-game days to get from coast to coast in that game. Supposedly that is about 3 hours in game. How there is an infection in that water that makes it harmful. Which is why you can't go in deep water, but you can go in shallow streams.

I do agree though, Capcom needs to hype this game. In my opinion this game looks to be one of the best games of the year. I just hope Capcom doesn't fuck it up with DLC.

With DLC and how Capcom likes to fuck with games, from what I have seen the only DLC really announced besides ""pre-order and get one of each weapon that will be good for 5 minutes"" I have heard of an 8 mission DLC pack. I mean big whoop it is 8 missions in an RPG of hundreds or thousands of quests.

I think the combat does look a lot like Dark Soul's. It has the unforgivingness of how it gets pitch black at night, how you can't kill every enemy at level 1. (Yeah people will do speed runs of not leveling their character and killing the Drake at level 1)

I apologize in advance for taking offense, but I honestly don't think a company from my country is the reason why they are doing a sub-par job on PR DD (which I do agree).

Anyways, my two-cents is that Capcom probably doesn't want to spend unnecessary expenditures on promotion of a brand new game (or series). I'm assuming that they are following the ""Don't fix things that ain't broken"" mentality, meaning they would rather PR more on the best-selling games.

To support what I mean by that, I see almost no commercial regarding DD on TV (in Japan). However, I still see commercials for Monster Hunter 3G (also by Capcom and one of best-selling series) on TV.

In most of the streams and interviews there has had to been a translator taking away from the coverage/game play. Their official facebook page looks more like a fan page and their forum for the game has under 1000 post since I last looked, around 600.

Also, I wanted to add that it's not really heavily promoted in Japan. However, the creators DO know their audience, and actually streamed the gameplays in Japan's most popular video website -Nico Nico Douga-. They also frequent twitter, where many gamers are known to lurk around.

Capcom also seems to know that fans will record the stream and publish the video on YouTube, hence them not publishing any video other than trailers and monsters on YouTube channels.

Elite Dangerous: Horizons,,,,Topbong,,,,,,,,t2_5uuer,,,"It's true that there is a limited market for the Kickstarter campaign, and once the relatively small number of nostalgic diehard fans have signed up, I wonder how many people will continue to do so over the remaining days. (After 2 days, it's currently at 28%, which may sound good, but these things always tail off very quickly if not kicked somehow.)

So I do think this is an interesting point, especially about social media (which is second nature to young, new developers, but to OG gamemakers like Braben, is not part of the DNA). It'll be interesting to see what the big old media might do about it, though - particularly the BBC. A few well-placed pieces from people who were young fans in the 80s and are now middle-aged journalists with a nice geek audience may help to raise the profile in a way that other games couldn't dream about.

Elite Dangerous: Horizons,,,,stoneforger,,cmdr,,,Stone,,,t2_6rnnh,,,"According to Braben, the game will sport Newtonian physics but the fly-by-wire system will be different (meaning combat will be like the original Elite, while spaceflight will be more like Frontier).

The tricky part is there will be a local hyperdrive instead of time compression, so as not to upset the multiplayer aspect, since there will be no lobby and player coop will be arranged in-game (like hailing your friend's ship when in the same star system or something like that).

The little footage that we've got from the BBC interview suggests atmospheric planets and such - stil that doesn't mean the seamless transition will be there.

Some backers have pointed out how cool it would be to actually being able to see re-entry at large Mach numbers, with extreme heat, scorch marks and so on visible.

This is more of a mystery rather than a popular question though; half the backers want some port or the other (iPads, consoles,etc.) or gripe about worrying how little we got so far in the way of updates and how the funding is crawling to a halt.

""I did this - I landed a ship on a planet travelling millions of miles around gas giants and planetoids. In one piece.""

I pledged because I've spent days waiting for enough crewmen to post job adds so I could bring back my Imperial Trader to federation space and make a ridiculous sum of money.

I pledged because past the 5 million credits point, I fitted an Asp Explorer with a Class 3 military drive, and roamed the systems, touching down on remote planets and letting the moons roll by  just to feel what it would be like.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1352474114.0,1352448914,,,0.0,,c6yq15m,,,t3_12wlbt,,,t3_12wlbt,,,2,False,,,EliteDangerous,t5_2vi60,,,,,,,1327670322.0,1.0,1430360025.0,311.0,,,,,,,,

What that will mean for you when the game is launched, is up for grabs.

It could be like being included in the credits, it could be an in-game mention of your Pilot's name. Maybe in the design phase the Elite Federation of Pilots could play a role in the multiplayer aspect, like a standards body, or some sort of guild.

I'm sure that's still not set in stone.

The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD,,,,DoomDarts,,,,,,,,t2_16yq03,,,"crossposting my comment from r/wii:
 
I love Twilight Princess, despite its flaws.  I think the single biggest negative is that it makes you not want to replay it as frequently, due to slow initial pacing and other factors.  On the plus side I think it has some of the best dungeons in the series, and I really appreciate that the dungeons ""ramp up"" in complexity much more quickly than normal.

This is an old video and once again it is interesting to hear his comments about not wanting voice acting in the Zelda series, save perhaps gibberish Hylian voices like Midna.  He argues it would be too easy to find poorly delivered lines (and ""no doubt it would be a train wreck"") as only the Japanse voice acting would get the full attention of the developers.

Overall, he feels one the main problems with Twilight Princess is that it is too much like Ocarina of Time, and sums it up by saying the game feels all too familiar in general.  This complaint certainly is widely shared but personally, I feel lucky that it has avoided souring my experiences.  The fact that TP is like another OoT, but also bigger and better in most areas, is part of why I enjoy it immensely!  I actually find it hard to place one above the other (and sometimes lean towards giving TP a slight edge) which I'm aware is an uncommon opinion.

Not hating on the other games, but every one of those games have a different theme, premise, and style. Turok was a First person shooter with Dinosaurs. There weren't many like it at the time the 1997 Turok: Dinosaur Hunter game came out.

There still aren't many games with dinosaurs that you can run around and shoot. Jurassic Hunter is one of the only other few.

So yeah, people still like Turok. Not only for the video games, but for the comic books as well, where it originated in 1954.

In essence, you can call many popular games today a ""cash-grab"", but that doesn't mean it is true. ",,,,,,,,0.0,,1426819478.0,1426794278,,,0.0,,cpk7qs7,,,t3_2zkwa6,,,t1_cpk7bs4,,,3,False,,,turok,t5_2uep1,,,,,,,1404683524.0,2.0,1427860314.0,642.0,,,,,,,,

Killzone 2,,,,Cameljock,,,,,,,,t2_3a4w3,,,"For those of you who can't access the Killzone forums to read this:

&gt; Here is a list that I complied from a bunch of sources which details all of the things that we will expect in Killzone 3. These include Multiplayer, Gameplay, Jetpacks, Graphics and Story.

    Story
&gt; Starts off right after Killzone 2. Sev, Rico and the ISA are trying to take down the Helghast

&gt; Development began right after Killzone 2 Shipped

&gt; Will show the Helghast have humanity left in them

&gt; Will include arctic levels

&gt; One mission in the game involves rescuing ISA Captain Narville

&gt; Will show off the Helghan culture

&gt; There is actually a Helghan language, which will be explored in the game

&gt; Better quality of dialogue and the writing

    Gameplay

&gt; Runs on the same engine as Killzone 2

&gt; Gameplay unchanged from KZ2

&gt; Improved melee system

&gt; You can stick a knife in a Helghan's ribcage and eye socket

&gt; Some Helghan AI have jetpacks

&gt; Larger scale environments

&gt; A lot of snow levels

&gt; More variety and enemy types

&gt; WASP: Primary fire releases missiles that spiral their way to a target. They have smoke trails. Secondary fire locks on to a target and then rains down rockets.

&gt; Jetpacks

&gt; There will be jetpacks!

&gt; L1 increases altitude. X gives players a speed boost

&gt; Easy to manoeuvre, light weight jetpacks

&gt; Jetpacks have a machine gun mounted on top on them

&gt; In one mission, you use the jetpack to launch yourself from glacier to glacier

    Graphics

&gt; First Sony title to Support 3D

&gt; Have to sit in the centre of the 3D TV for the 3D effects to work

&gt; Awesome effects like the player's gun popping out of the screen. Incredible snow particle effects and bullets flying out of the screen.

&gt; Only real graphical rival is Crysis

    Multiplayer

&gt; Just as important to Guerrilla as single player

&gt; Promised to be truly innovative

&gt; Going to have more “accessibility” than KZ2

When you see the Process attacking Red her entire body flickers like she was a glitch in the system. In fact some other enemies have these types of animations. They may have nothing to do with the story and be just a stylistic choice though.

Speaking of theories, I feel like the Process are really just dead people whose ""souls"" are integrated into these machine bodies. The Process kills people and then processes their bodies. Maybe it just absorbs them to give their masters information that will help them take over Cloudbank. The idea of eyes representing human souls isn't a new one. Traces of that concept can be found in other media as well. 

It's not really a far fetched idea with the whole ""people disappearing"" theme of the game.

Farming Simulator 17,,,,Marcaus_G_G,,,,,,,,,,,"Looking for Players for Farming Simulator 2017 

""Animal Manager Wanted""

We are in need to get onboard a Animal Manger.. This posiotion you will have complete control of animals that eople own and that you will own for yourself and free to do what you want to with.. Its laid back but there is a big responsibility to the matter. It will also be in your part to deliver such item's to whomever has put such things into it. Like wool milk and so forth. 

"" County Manger Wanted""

We are seeking out a County Manger that will be dedicated to are server. This isn't a ordinary server. Things are put in place for reasons and such, but as to that you will need to think upon at what you ae doing.. There is good and bad ways to doing things, and you will grow as your own on things what you want to invest in. As with this you willl be given 1,000,000 to start. Now this doesn't mean to go blow it on lavish unnecessary equipment lol. Look at whats around you and what is in the server before making final decisions. This postiotion will have various task at what you can control on your own terms as such as BGA/Diesel Plant/Warehouse/Cargill and more. At wich him/her want's or need's. Only thing that will be asked upon is the making of diesel.. There isnt a set amount but effort will be put into place. Theres more to the postion but hard to give all info. Thats more of what the person wants to do and not mine.

'Farmers Wanted""

We are seeking out some farmer's for the server..

With this position you will be granted 2,000,000 to start.. Him/Her will own there own farm and your own set up at the way you want to run things.

""Server and Map""

We are on the North West Texas Map. This map is custom, and by me i have built upon it. With that said any map that we run in ""conjuction"" with this map will more and likely be customised to what were actually trying to accomplish. 

Most important part i can say to are maps and this game is ""time"" scale. People like to go fast pace on server's and alot of people cant find goals \(at wich i cant give to people\), but i can find things in nature to help cut down on that, but as for you as a player are gonna have to think upon it.. We run seasons with 3 day intervals of seasons at a time scale of .80... At wich it is custom you will actually have 2 planting ""harvest seasons"" ""spring harvest"" ""winter harvest"". Do not let this time scale fool you and with seasons. In reality your playing the actual base game time. My main rule to it is lets go fast paced and time will be speed up at only if everyone dedicated to the server is on.. if wanting to join something long term then this is your spot.

""Mods""

This server is heavily moded. We currently have like 120.

As with this all mods will meet requirements of they will be updated by whom ever has knowledge in mods and how they work, at wich i will give the final go ahead and get them in the server. 

Anyone can suggest for mods to be put in but i have guidlines to them.. All mods will be based upon realism including prices and will be given the upmost guidline. So that doesnt mean to go find a mod that has a working with of 100ft or something because i wont put it in lmao.

Another i look upon is duplicate mods.. I will never put in mods that has took at what giants has created and turned it into there own.

Why so many mods? Thats because people like to play with differnt items and people like variety on such.. As for me im from the U.S and i love goin green, then theres some that like Krone or whatever, There at wich why this server is heavily moded.

""Mod's Breaking"". I know poeple carry a big part in there operations for a mod and if something happens to ones mod, Before removing it i will do the best of my knowledge in moding to fix at whatever needs to be fixed with it on a time sensetive time scale. As for this i will not ever garuntee that it can be updated.. Enter mods at your own risk.

""Since so many mods"". As for this server it is best practice to keep my mods away from any other mod and keep them seperate. Do not try and update them with ""Mod Hub"" or replace any mods with another. 

""Discord""

We use dicord and i have it for multiple reasons. I do not require a mic to join but it is a must to have it. If intrested to join in something great just click on the link https://discord.gg/av4jas and me or whomever will get you set up.

""Discord Rules"" I will not tolerate any kinda racism white pride black lives matter or whatever. My Discord is for people and the people around it.

""Discord Links"" I dont mind people using are mods nor do i mind people using the map

but i will not tolerate people coming on. Acting like there gonna play. Then take off with the map or mods.. Then use it on there terms. As with that if caught i will block you. 

""If wanting to use it without playing on the server Just Ask About It"". 

""Warning"" map is built for multiplayer use and is not inteded for single player some fuctions has been removed.

""Another Main rule that will get you blocked"" If joining Farming Simulator server and you are given a such position Farmer/County Manager/ Animal Manager"" you are also saying that your gonna be commited to the server.. Im not saying that you have to talk to me all the time but if your gone for so long and i cant talk to you or if you dont even care to respond to my messages. Question Becomes why should I not block you? Im left there to pick up the peices you have created. That for one chaps my you know what.

""Note"" If just wanting to join and tag along your free to do so. We will always need some help along the way with such matter's.

if any question feel free to ask.

If i need a bunch of forts then i just select my heroes to go to the forts and once they all arrive i take control of them to seize the forts 1 by 1. You can give more complicated orders for units you dont get access to but can order such as telling sakura to heal people. If the problem is that your ai take too long to complete and order because they suck at fighting then just plan every objective you need to do at that moment and set up the heroes you can switch to infront of the objective. This also works for stuff like sending a fast unit to reach anna and then just switching to that unit whenever you have the free time. That way you wont need to run around the map and you can order the hero after you finish their objective.

Most combos are y 1 to 3 times and x.

Just take some time beating up enemies to relearn the combos. Yyyx with rowen for example is a good aoe while yxx is a faster combo for about the same damage.

The small E under the weapon icon means someone is using that weapon already.
I dont know what weapon statuses are tbh, we might have to just wait for a list to be made.

Im pretty sure reforging only lets you take one attribute but that might change when i get further into the game.

To use potions is the same menu that pair ups and dual strikes are in. ZR and your potion button (probably b) will make you use a vulnerary.

I think I may set this game aside until there is a control summary somewhere. I have no clue what the icons like keys mean or the swoop lines under some characters.

Chest, find a key on the map or wait for a thief to appear who will open the chest or you kill them and take the key.

Camilla disappearing sounds weird, I notice I occasionally get randomly switched to a different character but then I switch back, maybe you got a glitch.

 X and Y are light and heavy, you mostly just mix them up but if you check a character status in the convoy you can see the combos which are all as simple as Light 1-5 times then a heavy depending on how many light attack you do you will execute a different heavy.

Overall, my opinion is that this has already been one of the more successful games I have backed on KickStarter, and that is just on the beta.

In my opinion, you'll have a much easier time just getting a Wii and softmodding it to play Japanese games.

When I play with controllers, I use the face buttons instead of the triggers for kats. I think it's way easier this way.

[Wii Remote](http://i.imgur.com/q01NLe6.jpg)

[Classic Controller](http://i.imgur.com/Pj2MAA3.jpg)

Since your PS2 doesn't have very good triggers, you might have better luck with this layout.

If you're going to buy the drum controller (Tatacon), it's important to know that it's not sensitive at all, so you have to hit it hard for it to register; and even so, it doesn't work well. Luckily, there is a very easy mod to fix this problem. There are plenty of video tutorials on YouTube (In Japanese, but it's pretty self-explanatory). I'll find one and post it here later.

Dolphin has native Wiimote support, so you shouldn't have to mess around with drivers and software; just connect them via BT and sync them to Dolphin. Outside of that, I've had so much trouble connecting Wiimotes to PC in the past, and it just wasn't worth it.

Reversing don/kat will take way too much time for me to get used to and I probably wouldn't prefer it :P 

Regarding the Tatacon, that's definitely an information worth knowing. I can speak Japanese fluently (also understand it) so I won't have any problems with Japanese videos. It'd be great if you can post the video when you find it!

I'm having a really hard time finding classic controllers on local retailers recently, but I think I'll look for it online and try connecting a Wii-mote to my PC.

So aside from the accuracy of hitting the notes (perfectly = Ryou [yellow], sorta off = Ka [white]), one other driving force of high scores is the Renda (those yellow lines where you spam for points).
The problem with the Tatacon is that without modding, the sensitivity is utter crap compared to the arcade version. With a relatively simple but tedious mod, you can increase the sensitivity to the point where it'll pick up on light taps with your fingers.
^Where this comes into play is important. The 2 most popular ways of Renda are as follows:
1. The Double Stroke
2. The Roll
I can only explain so much typed out so i'll include links for visuals.
1. The Double Stroke - fairly simple concept, but difficult to master (it took me 3-4 weeks to master it). The Tatacon center is split into a left side and a right side, and the basis of the DS is with one ""swipe"" or ""stroke"" you hit both sides, ideally doubling the amount you'd achieve by just hitting it like you do in the video. Here's a link showing the finger position and what it should look like: 
http://youtu.be/ElUIIQBn4PI
2. The roll - this one is easier once you get the hang of it. So what you do is you hold the bachi (sticks) like you normally would but with a light grip between your thumb and index finger, and swing it down. I can't explain for crap so here's a video explaining it: 
http://youtu.be/-ChcoIaC9Hs
This is also why many dedicated players (myself included) have those pencil-like tapered bachi (kinda sharpened to a point), because this technique utilizes the rebounding force of the rubber center and the taper makes it bounce more, meaning more hits.
(Note: you can do both of these techniques or just continue doing Renda the way you are in the video without any mod of any kind, it's just the sensitivity mod makes it much easier to play fast songs and greatly helps with renda).
About the mod -
In case you're afraid of breaking it when doing this sort of mod, think of it this way: you have to actually try to break it in order to break it. The cables are incredibly sturdy and as long as you don't rip it apart by brute force, it'll be just fine. There are many how-to videos on youtube. Given, they're in Japanese, but i can translate all that for you if you're interested.
I actually went all-out and made an extensive mod of the Tatacon where i take the sensors out and put them on a big wood plate thing to increase the surface area and make the tatacon more arcade-like while also increasing the sensitivity greatly. This is an album of my bachi and the Tatacon in all of their glory (uploaded in the wrong order): http://m.imgur.com/a/BLduM
Also one skill that's really useful is looking up the fumen (the organization of the notes, idk what it's called in English) on google, for example the ura of Rotter Tarmination. The ending where the notes scroll by at a tremendous spead is called a ""Sofuran"" and most people who have mastered the song looked up the fumen and memorized the difficult part. If you can't type Japanese then you can just find a list of songs from the game, copy-paste them into Google and tag ""譜面"" at the end (so in this case it would be ""Rotter Tarmination 裏譜面"" [裏 = Ura]) and click on the site called ""wikia"" and you can scroll down and see the fumen for yourself.

I've seen a lot of videos on the mod, but I could only follow it visually because I don't know Japanese, so I probably don't understand the mod completely. Maybe I should show you some pictures of mine so you can see what I did wrong. Your tatacon mod looks really neat, by the way!

Any% you just have to get the final painting as fast as possible, timer starts when the ""loading screen 100%"" fades and ends when the little after credit scene fades to black. You cannot use console commands but any glitch, OOB, or anything like that you can find is fair game. Sub 1h 30m MUST be recorded in some fashion (will be easier to manage once [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com) accepts the game for hosting on its site).

&amp;#x200B;

100% is do all story missions, Thug missions, and all the blackbay contracts as well as get all the cars and have the van. In essence do every mission you possibly can and have all the major items in the game. 100% is still in flux at the moment because the runners have not really worked on it yet because they have been trading back and forth records for any%.

&amp;#x200B;

* A path system that's not as frustrating as Planet Coaster, please

* A fixed gizmo. Not the broken Planet Coaster gizmo, please.

* Restaurants from the get-go. Individual stands do exist, but Zoo's focus more on having a bigger restaurant, especially small zoo's
  
* Also eco-display-like feature. I can't really fully explain what it is, but the Burger's Zoo here in Arnhem, the Netherlands has 4 ecosystems: The Bush, Desert, Ocean, and Mangrove. Certain animals like birds and reptiles roam free in those eco-displays, where of course bigger animals would still be enclosed. These eco-displays are accessible for the whole year no matter the weather outside and resemble their real-life ecosystems as much as possible. But that's maybe something for a DLC.

Trials of Mana,[],,,Caliber70,,,[],,,,text,t2_3n2ohgz4,False,,"The problem with remakes is they have too little ambition in general.  Secret of mana remake, Link's awakening remake, Ocarina 3DS, just took the same games with the same flaws and just made it 3D/higher res/poly count.  A proper remake would be closer to FF7 remake changes.  The trials of mana demo we saw was a lazy remake.

You take the same idea, same plot, but adapt it to modern technology and updated presentation.  Waiting turns is no longer exciting or acceptable in todays' technology because we have the chips and processors that can make it amazing, as opposed to back then they were just aiming to make a decent looking combat simulation.

So we saw how Jadd looks but that was literally the lazy remake treatment they gave to the titles i mentioned earlier.  They could built a Jadd that had the same buildings in the same locations relative to north south east west, but also have MORE places of interest in the same city, they could ADD.  Just ADD.

Seiken densetsu 3 was special because no other SNES game had the backgrounds and scenery and maps that looked that good, during the era of the SNES.  The demo we saw was purely a copy of the map from the SNES , given a tiny little height elevation and using the same colors made to impress if it were a SNES/phone game.  the equivalent to SD3's quality from back then in modern games would be closer to breath of the wild or Monster hunter world or the witcher 3's maps.  Basically they are now building the game to be an impressive SNES/phone game, not a PS4/Switch capable game.

The combat looks to have the same issues as above.  FF15 is what they should be aiming for in the Mana series' combat.  A team of characters, can be solo controlled or team co-op, given the basics of action adventure RPGs like dodging, parrying, solo combos and team combos, putting in some careful consideration to positioning, stunning abilities, like Dark Souls but FASTER and more smooth movement taking advantage of the ""action"" in the ""action adventure"" label.  Basically i want a careful mixing of Prototype and FF15's combat.   The demo we saw they aimed to build an imppressive SNES/phone game again, not a PS4/switch level game.

So ye, remakes in general just have no ambition.  Too many old fans resist changes, it makes the developers too scared to change too much and gamers as a whole suffer because some old fans get caught up in nostalgia.",,,,,,,,,,1564671474.0,1564646274,,,,{},evograq,,False,t3_cfnt16,False,True,t3_cfnt16,/r/trialsofmana/comments/cfnt16/what_are_you_hoping_square_does_to_not_fuck_this/evograq/,,1,,True,False,trialsofmana,t5_12zyfv,,,,0.0,,,,,1564646285.0,,,,,,,,,

In both Duelist designs you can see that Duran's upper legs are bare and that his helmet and pauldrons are made of skulls.

The new design is actually closer to the original artwork than the sprites were in the 1995 game. The reason why you might find the new design jarring is because it doesn't match the sprite at all; the original duelist sprite was black with purple pants! This was probably necessary at the time to differentiate the different classes using just color palette swaps, which in turn is something they likely had to resort to because of hardware limitations at the time.

Personally I prefer the newer and more fancy designs, though I hope they will include the different hair colors for the class changes in the final game (currently it's quite boring that Duran has red hair for each class chane).

I bought 12 because I needed some new everyday glasses, and these were a great price! I love that a few extra projects can make a dinner party feel so special!
For the thread reel, cut out the pattern pieces for the reel and the block of thread from the grey and pink fabrics. And aren t those hand-blown etched glass tumblers beautiful? Like with any wreath-making project, you just have to layer and then wrap tightly with floral wire. I used Oakshott Lipari Salina for mine, which is not one of the Scandinavia fabrics.
I am available for teaching worldwide and am now taking bookings for Australia and internationally from January 2016 onwards. I am booked out for 2015.
The book won t arrive until September/October so if you order a pincushion AND a book together, they won t come until then unless you place two seperate orders.
It s better to have a longer zip not a shorter one, you can always trim it back. Place the pouch front on top of the zipper, face down. Pin through all three layers.

Hades,,,,usancus,,,[],,,,text,t2_qprq0,False,,"Ya, that upgrade for the shield seems kind of OP. In general I feel like the bow/sword are just underpowered starter weapons, because even a Q build with the shield is better at range than the bow...but there's two major reasons:

1) Deflect is OP, especially Deflect on charging LMB because it lets you sit there for a second and think about what you want to do next without taking any damage, heck, you even deal damage in return. You have to play much faster with every other weapon.

2) The game seems inherently biased towards slow weapons due to the synergy between Artemis' crit-on-dash boon which is the strongest damage improvement for a single boon, and the +100% attack damage after Dash from the Mirror. In theory the spear is actually decent, especially for clearing large groups with Zeus' lightning proc boon, because it is so fast, but because its per attack damage is low you do way less damage in a Dash-Attack-Dash pattern than with the shield, and the game pushes you super hard towards Dash-Attack-Dash. It does far more damage than any other attack style.

If there are slower, higher damage-per-hit weapons in a future update(and I'm sure there will be) they will definitely outdamage the shield, at least, and I think that the Mirror needs to get some kind of bonus type that helps fast weapons in the way the % damage after Dash helps slow weapons.

Shield with 1 upgrade and 1 boon does &gt;300 damage per normal attack with no pull time at all, deflects, hits everything in a frontal arc *for free* AND also knocks back letting you benefit from wall smash and knocking enemies into traps.

The bow's biggest drawback is that LMB charge for some reason doesn't pierce, which is insanely bad when you consider it has no defensive capabilities and that the Q is too slow to be usable for just about anything in Asphodel. When you have 4 Elites in front of you and you pull with the bow you are just wasting time, with the shield you would hit all of them for 1.5-2x the damage, deflect all their attacks, and smash them into any nearby terrain for even more damage.

Shield charge LMB makes the bow look even worse, because it does pierce, does more base damage, deflects for free the entire time you charge, and ALSO is a super long range dash that lets you reposition for free.

Spear would be comparable to Shield if they changed the Mirror's +100% damage after dashing from '1 attack' to '1 second duration', right now fast weapons hardly benefit from it which is a big downside for the Spear since there is no other Mirror bonus that benefits it more.

But it's also worth noting that there are a lot of weapons coming in future updates and it's entirely possible that the Sword and Bow are intended to be cheap starter weapons and not as good as more expensive ones. Any changes/additions to the Mirror could also completely change weapon balance.

Streetpass doesn't seem to be so important afterall because as soon as I got them I could beat all the remaining bosses pretty easily. (man is the ninja ability op in this game .. O.O)

And while I kept on playing there is some some random guy who said, that you'll keep your citizens in the full game, as well as all your friends and this abilink-feature. So it may be useful to upgrade your knight, white mage and black mage so your friends (if they use your character as an abilink) have an easier start once they start with the game. I think this may be a hint that you have to unlock some of the jobs you had acces to in the demo.

Bravely Default II,,,,Dan_Tsukasa,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm currently abroad but still using the UK store, I won't be back in England for another 2 weeks and I couldn't wait, so I decided to pay the full price for the game from the eStore £39.99 (seriously, nintendo just doesn't seem to understand that eStores should be cheaper...).

Since its downloaded it doesn't come with the AR card however, which is kinda sad because the opening movie asks you to use it, you can still watch it without and the console just approximates where things should be for you.

I'm 20 minutes into it so far (download took FOREVER!) after purchasing it at 1am UK time (2am my time), and there goes my weekend and probably most of Christmas.

A little on the features for anyone interested:

Audio Language can be Japanese or English
(Great for someone like me who didn't quite like the English voice acting for some characters).

Text language is great, you can pick from every language the games being sold in, including Japanese, which for someone like me is great as I can catch up on my Kanji before i head to Japan by doing a Japanese only run on my 2nd playthrough.

Other:
You don't unlock the brave/default moves at the very beginning, those are unlocked in an event, and you can't purchase magic at a store until you've unlocked the white or black mage jobs.

* You need to buy spells from the store in town, much like older Final Fantasy games.

* You can cross equip skills between jobs, for example; I have a Performer, with Valkyrie commands as my secondary action, with the ""two handed"" skill from Knight equipped.

* There is a lot of mixing and matching with the jobs, I would recommend maxing all jobs in the demo so you can tailor your party to your liking. Don't be afraid to experiment!

* I leveled Tiz and Edea to level 4 Performers, for the atk and def bonus at the end of each round, then Knight to level 2 for the two hand skill, and valkyrie to level 2 for crescent moon. (Allows you to hit all enemies with a two handed weapon, which is nice).

If you're going on about the hitbox problem which is visible if you slow the trailer down, that was explained many times as well.  It's a pre-alpha teaser, nothing more, and the video was taken when the 1st person and 3rd person hitboxes were not fully aligned.  


Mordhau still has the a hitbox difference when you're playing locally in singleplayer and Marox explains why here...  maybe that will help you out.

But, objectively chiv did do some things better.

1: voicelines. They are simply better. Anyone who has played both games knows. Mason maa battle cry will never be forgotten 

2: Maps. Specifically, maps that play out in TO. Although, the maps are still usually better. Frontline is bland and only 2 people actually play the objective while in chiv every TO was pretty unique and allowed for player made maps as well.

Set up your artillery so that they can immediately focus fire on the tower capable of engaging your forces. When the match starts, have the artillery pelt the daylights out of that tower until it falls. Your next point of focus will depend on your army composition: If cavalry and monster biased, take out the wall itself next; If infantry and archery focused, take out their archers and gunners.

Basically keep using the artillery until your ammo runs out with them. You can also use bombardment and direct damage spells to further annihilate particular threats on the wall until Winds of Magic run out. After that, move up with sword infantry first and have them climb the walls. If you busted a hole in the walls, move your monsters up first, with the cavalry kept nearby.

Mount Your Friends,,,,goldmonkey007,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm gonna fight you over the technique names!

At one point (maybe the first video), you referenced ""cartwheeling"" as the action of alternated climbing with your hands and feet. We have dubbed it the ""hand-over-foot technique"".  I have a habit of ""casting"" the match while I wait for my turn...my friends on skype have a hard time climbing if they are crying laughing :-p.

Here's a brief rundown for funsies :)

**Hand-over-foot** -- keeping both feet or both hands attached while swinging the other up and over in order to climb the tower.  Its a very safe, albeit a bit slow, climbing technique since an accidental release of one appendage doesn't spell disaster.

**Panic Release** -- when you have 3 seconds left and are climbing as fast as possible, only to derp and release the only point of contact you have, which sends you tumbling off the tower.

**Launching** -- Using dem physics and a single point of contact to generate rotational momentum with the rest of your body and releasing the point of contact mid-swing to send yourself flying (hopefully) vertically up the tower.

**Cartwheel** -- An advanced Launching technique that relies on well placed limbs to *briefly* stick on a point of contact on the tower near the end of your Launch to give leverage to your other limbs to continue the rotational momentum before releasing yet again.  With quick fingers and practice, you can link several launches together in quick succession using this technique.

**Slingshot** -- Another advanced launching technique that relies on the joint physics of the mounters.  It has been observed that the arm and leg joints are not rigid, but rather ""slightly elastic.""  When launching, instead of tracing a circle to create rotational momentum, trace an ellipse.  At the ""corner"" of the ellipse, your joints will stretch ever so slightly, but snap back into place with surprising force.  If you release your launch during this snap-back, you get even MORE momentum from your launch.  The benefit is, you don't need to trace a full circle to get the required launch velocity.

**Ice-skating**  -- When approaching the Goat, create rotational momentum with your feet to push you towards the goat with your feet above your head.  Your arms are arranged such that only ONE will come in contact with the ground.  Before this happens, you keep that hand active (hold down the button) so it doesnt stick.  The result is that your rotational momentum is transformed into purely lateral momentum (because your non-sticky arm stops the rotation) as you slide...or skate...toward the goat.

**Gettin' Sticky** -- Due to a poor launch or poor climbing, your mounter ends up with 4 points of contact all clustered together.  This kills any momentum (physically or mentally) that the mounter had and precious seconds are wasted trying to carefully unstick the needed limbs.

These are just some examples.  I may have to make a not-quite-so-serious-yet-totally-serious video demonstrating techniques we have found. :-p

Killzone: Mercenary,,,,eriorkless,,,,,PSN: Ctrl__V,,,t2_6lfjs,,,"For me, it all depends on the rounds in Warzone or the way I feel like playing at the moment.


**When I feel like a complete Ninja Badass I usually run:**

* **Body Armor: Infiltrator.** The only armor for a Ninja Badass.

* **Primary: StA-52 Assault Rifle.** Versatile, decent range, great damage--and it has a cool silencer that makes you feel like a reconnaissance class. To be honest, I feel like this is the most over powered weapon in the game.

* **Secondary: M2 Tranquilizer Pistol OR VC8 Shotgun Pistol** This all depends if I want to be a team player or not. When I want to help the team (or it's the interrogation round in Warzone) I roll with the Tranq Pistol. But that Shotgun Pistol man... It's hella beautiful.

* **Equipment: M194 Frag** I usually run stock grenade. It's how I was raised. My team can use M133 Prox mines, but if I die by one of yours. You're scum to me.

* **VAN-Guard: Vultur** Bar-none. This has got to be nerfed or something... ^^^Or_more_people_need_to_realize_that_you_can_shoot_it_down.

(Sometimes I run Ghost when I want to be super stealthy. Plus, it's one of the few VAN-Guards that can't be just shot down, which is a huge plus.)

___________

**When I want to be that one guy who doesn't die:**

Basically everything up top except:

* **Primary: STA-52SE Assault Rifle OR STA-14 Rifle.** This is really a toss up, I'm a rifleman kind of guy. But then again, STA-14 Assault Rifle is just way powerful.

* **Secondary: VC8 Shotgun Pistol.** All the way.

* **Armor: Ballistic.** You can sponge so much more damage with Ballistic. It's ridiculous... How your footsteps thunk is also ridiculous but you gotta give a little to get a little.

But yes, the storyline is pretty awesome! You can follow up the story and the interaction of all the characters runs very smoothly. 

And yes, the loading screens. This is because it uses an RPG modification of the Unreal Engine, I believe that changing a FPS optimized engine to another genre is a huge work (which is admirable) but a resources killer.

Are you really playing it? How are you doing it? Do you have that Xbox and the original game? I have it (in my hometown) and was going to pick it again, but my Xbox was so loud that I didn't even continue. BTW the music is like... no comments.

The further you go, the more zombies there are, till it starts to add up. Almost every person I've seen die has died because they finally ran out of ammo (the ominous clicking sound of an empty gun).

I'm pretty sure the musical composer also worked on Attack on Titan and has a similar sound. Since this new game will have more of a ""futuristic"" theme compared to the first (mechs, guns in battle, etc) I think the battle music we've heard so far sounds pretty appropriate.

Golden Sun: Dark Dawn,,,,PhatBoiRL,,,,,,,,t2_40vrq,,,"Here's what I'll be expecting from the sequel.  All in my opinion.

**Less moon-like running.**  I wasn't really feeling the run.  Final Fantasy III and Nostalgia's running looked better.

**Re-do the item menu.**  Being able to see all the items a character is holding on the top screen is fine, but I didn't like the one-at-a-time scrolling at the bottom screen.

**More difficult puzzles.**  Perhaps bringing back all the old puzzle solving psynergies and adding some more will also help.

**Slower leveling.**  Way too fast!  I also maxed out their levels with the help of the Tua Warriors in the last area.  The leveling speed in the GBA versions were the right way to go.

**Stronger weapons.**  They already showed the Sol Blade and Excalibur, so they have to best those now.  I'd like to see them outdo Megiddo.

**More summons.**  Just a handful would be fine.  Maybe adding four more summons where you need five of the same element.

**Having someone from Tuaparang join the group.**  Add some more variety to the group, you know?  Sveta was a unique addition to the group.

**BATTLE ARENA.**  I want to endlessly fight monsters that slowly get stronger and battle with my friends.  Maybe have 4v4 or 8v8 battles instead of 3v3.

the plot is okay, but it only makes some of the characters important. and I was upset that they shoved all 8 party members into the same game instead of balancing them out like in the originals.

It's more than a little obvious that Weyward is turning into Earth. all of the locations correspond to real life locations. they even have the Great Wall of China for crying out loud. 

**MOST IMPORTANTLY** what I realized is that they were marketing this to the wrong demographic. they marketed to kids who probably weren't even born when the original games came out. they SHOULD have marketed to older teens and adults who had played and enjoyed the first games. they simplified it rather than making it more challenging. they were trying to make new fans rather than trying to please the old loyal fans; us. and that makes me sad.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1316256824.0,1316231624,,,0.0,,c2khdun,,,t3_h0pz8,,,t3_h0pz8,,,1,False,,,GoldenSun,t5_2s75v,,,,,,,1308422371.0,1.0,1427610677.0,12083202.0,,,,,,,,

2. Fusing affinities to your character (you can't do it with any demon but the Nahobino) changes their elemental and status weaknesses and resistances. In fact this might be the single biggest use of Essence fusion i've seen, because you can nullify enemy damage on the Nahobino and effectively make certain spells not even a threat to him, which is good because if he's hit by elements he's weak to, he's pretty fragile, which is bad because his death is game over. You'll want to take stock of the abilities your enemies are using, find elemental parralels and then fuse those resistances to get the most out of the system.

3. You get demon and skill slots from the Domain of Shadows. Select Apotheosis in that menu, then the topmost option and you'll see skills you can get with Glory. You find that mostly from finding Miman, crystal deposits and beating Mitama. But look through the skills and you'll slowly but surely build up more slots, though slots for the player is seperate from demons. Why? I dunno. You can get more of these bonuses available by taking out Abscesses, but i don't recommend haphazardly going after them.  Beef yourself up first cuz those demons do not mess around.",,,,,,,,,,1637016424.0,1636991224,,,,{},hkqbinn,,False,t3_qu2zqt,False,True,t3_qu2zqt,/r/shinmegamitenseiv/comments/qu2zqt/help_with_fusion_please/hkqbinn/,,2,,True,False,shinmegamitenseiv,t5_3iz9r,,,,0.0,[],,,,1637296928.0,,,,[],,,,,

Just don't be afraid to fuse your old demons.  It will help you long term.

Essence fusion lets you add skills (aka spells, etc) to your main character or a demon, skills they may not by default learn. So, want a heal spell on that demon you love but don't use because you don't want to replace a support/heal-oriented demon?  you could learn it from a pixie essence. 

Also, some monsters have the potential to learn powerful versions of types of skills. For example, the weird little purple hungry ghost guys have the potential to learn +3 to darkness skills... but do not learn any darkness spells from leveling alone. So... untapped potential unless you use essence fusion to give them one from an essence.

\-Dark Sandflame: Same as D.Xiong Mao, resonate a normal one with 1º A6 2º B20 and convert to dark  
\-Dark Xue Hu: Same, resonate a normal with 1º A18 2º E7 and turn to dark  
\-Lightning Dragon: 1º F30 2º F4 Here a Fact, Lightning Dragon is, if I remember the Invizimals with highest attack in 3, so, if you get his attack to max and resonate you have a good attack machine.  
\-Jetcrab: 1º F5 2º B20  
\-Metalmutt: Normal Unown but his dark is 1º F11 2º E1, You maybe in this can think, But doesn't Dark being the same as Normal and well yes but actually no, if you resonate the normal you get the resonance in the dark BUT the resonance change and can be different.

Göteborgs Posten gave the film another 3/5 score. Following several surreal scenes of carnage and mayhem blurring the lines between horror and comedy the film ends on a dark note with Annika managing to kill Beckert but succumbing to her own vampirism. Jonas Lawes - Robert They were so disappointed, he said of Brash and Osborne at the thought of giving up their summit attempt.
Anthony Lledo, who had worked with Anders Banke before, was selected to write the score. The producers drew inspiration from vampire films such as The Lost Boys, Fright Night, The Fearless Vampire Killers and Peter Jackson s Bad Taste. Petra Nielsen was cast as Annika; she was always Banke s first choice for the part. Grete Havensköld, who had starred in Astrid Lindgren films as a child, was cast as Annika s daughter Saga. Per Löfberg had been in the hit romcom Ha ett underbart liv and in the cult film Evil Ed and was cast in a then-secret role, and Carl-Åke Eriksson had played small parts in several films and television series was cast as the professor.
The score was very well received by critics. Rue Morgue called it one of the most stirring horror soundtracks in recent years. Missing from the album is Tyomnaja Notch by Leonid Utyosov that is played over the opening credits. The name of the song means Dark Night. Other than the score the soundtrack is mostly made up of Swedish pop- and rock-music, among those Millencolin, Luleå hardcore punk band Raised Fist, Langhorns, Quit Your Dayjob, Son Kite and then newcomers BWO.
Sjöström notes that, rather than joking away the horror, horror and comedy are wrapped tightly together, as in the scene where Saga walks into the aftermath of the bloodbath and encounters John, who laughs grimly at her with a helium voice, or as in the film s infamous gnome-scene. He lays weight on the fact that, while following traditional vampire mythology closely, the film puts it into context with modern Sweden. In the spirit of Swedish secularism, the priest role in the film is reduced. He argues that if the film had been made in a more religious country, the priest would have been a main character, who would have provided information about the vampires and lead the fight against them. Instead, the teens know everything about vampires and are just surprised that they are real, rather than confused what to do.
You help people when they need help. Title: Frostbitten (2006) 5.5 /10. Osborne wrote up SummitClimb s report on the Hall rescue. Saga arrives at John s house and soon all hell breaks out when John turns into a vampire - the pills being capsules containing the vampiric blood of Maria enhanced by Beckert - and rampages through the house killing or infecting several party guests. Born and residing in: Sweden
He lingered at Tibet s base camp longer than the Mainers, though, long enough to learn of Sharp s death. Initially, said Watson in an interview, there was little buzz about the death at the Everest camps. We all know the risk, he said. People die on Everest every year.

Padayappa is an engineer who returns to his village from Chennai to attend his sister s wedding. His sister is engaged to their maternal uncle s son Suryaprakash. During his stay, he comes across Vasundhara, and falls in love with her. However, shyness and fear of Neelambari, her landlady, prevents Vasundhara from initially expressing her feelings. In addition, Neelambari is Suryaprakash s spoiled sister, who is madly in love with Padayappa.
It was also the first Tamil film to be released worldwide with 210 prints, and 700,000 audio cassettes. The film s rights in Japan were sold for US$50,000, which was the highest an Indian film fetched for commercial release in 1999. Co-producer Thenappan registered the film posters as a Class 34 trademark in 1998, to be used for trademarking such items as beedis, cigarettes, cheroots and tobacco, making it the first instance of brand extension in the Tamil film industry. The pre-release business of the film s overseas rights amounted to ₹ 30 million. Ananda Vikatan, in its original review of the film dated 25 April 1999, wrote, Original stamp of Rajni style can be seen in the film several times.

Sean Donovan’s mental status is brought up as questionable as he seems to see things that are not really there. That is why the viewer will be uncertain if Sean is really taking a certain illegal drug or not. Whether he is mental cohesive or not, taking drugs or not, these questions add new dimensions to Sean’s character, as did his ability to speak Chinese. The flashbacks of family were good as was the present day scene where Terry Donovan (Bill Sage) makes himself not buy beer in a supermarket and how that is connected to his and his family’s dark past. The perpetration of the final death in the film was ingenious and the scene was orchestrated and performed as though its producers were upperclass men in the film world.
Like the protagonists in Defendor and Kick-Ass, in Boy Wonder, an ordinary person with no powers or extraordinary abilities decides to take criminal confrontation and apprehension matters into his own hands in and under the surly streets of New York City. The ending to this scene was idiotic: Teresa Ames (Zulay Henao), a female detective, gives chase to Boy Wonder. A traumatized boy grows into a shy, determined teenager who patrols the mean streets of New York City, helping those in need and dishing out severe punishment to remorseless thugs. Tracy Middendorf as Mary Donovan
A young Brooklyn boy witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and grows up obsessed with finding her killer. Written by Michael Morissey. Boy Wonder 2010 - on the subway Rating is available when the video has been rented. This feature is not available right now.
In this respect, Boy Wonder’s actions mimic those of Judge Dredd and The Punisher, a variation on the mind/internal workings of these two stewards of justice. Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote, Morrissey displays a flair for moody atmospherics as his protagonist wanders Gotham s streets and subways at night, but the film relies too heavily on cryptic flashbacks and deliberate gaps in the narrative to create suspense, revealing rather than fleshing out connective tissue. The gloss of Kick-Ass is completely wiped away in Boy Wonder as is the glamor and rewards of vigilantism. Unlike Defendor’s zeal without mental or physical competency and Kick-Ass’s superhero aspirations generated from a comic book artist’s pen, Sean Donovan (Caleb Steinmeyer) has been training in boxing and hand-to-hand combat for sometime.
Enraged by the memory, he savagely beats a fellow student who has been harassing a female friend. Teresa finds a picture of Terry and the murderer and realizes that they knew each other before the attack. Sean assumes that Terry staged the attack in order to get his mother s life insurance money. Sean confronts his father, but Terry adamantly denies this.

The Orange County Bar Association is considering the formation of a section dedicated to the practice of criminal law. It is contemplated that the section would be open for both public and private attorneys—prosecutors and defense. A guidance counselor mistakenly sends out the wrong transcripts to Stanford University under the name of an over-achieving high schooler. Shaun Brumder is a local surfer kid from Orange County who dreams of going to Stanford to become a writer and to get away from his disfunctional family household.
Orange County movie clips: Don t miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: When Ashley (Schuyler Fisk) accidentally gives some of Lance s pills to the Dean (Harold Ramis), Shaun (Colin Hanks) tries his best to make the case for his acceptance. Some cast and crew from NBC s highly acclaimed, little-seen series Freaks and Geeks reunite for this teen comedy that also marks the first starring role for Tom Hanks son, Colin.
He s had his sights set on Stanford ever since he read the works of professor Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline), and his transcript is stellar enough to gain him admission. Many of these deaths and injuries can be prevented through the proper use of car seats, booster seats and seatbelts. It s one of those movies where the description can t do justice to the experience. Story of My Life (Live) - Social Distortion
He maintained a friendly, professional and business like demeanor as he dealt with his co-workers and members of the community he served. Sergeant Davis is survived by his wife and three children. September 16, 2015 National Child Passenger Safety WeekDid you know that car crashes are a leading cause of death for children 1 to 13? September 13 through September 19, 2015 is Child Passenger Safety Week.
Disaster strikes again, however, when Ashley drugs Durkett by accident with Lance s ecstasy, stored in an Excedrin bottle, thereby causing Durkett to become high. Things go from bad to worse when Shaun and Ashley arrive at the Admissions Building and find it engulfed in flames (caused by Lance carelessly starting a small fire). They abandon the hallucinating Durkett and flee the scene to avoid being arrested. Ashley finally becomes frustrated with Shaun s obsession of only getting into Stanford, and points out that his attending would mean they would be separated, thus ending their relationship. She then angrily leaves Shaun on his own.
Lizzy Caplan as Party Girl Alexandra Breckenridge (uncredited) as Anna Kevin Kline (uncredited) as Marcus Skinner Ben Stiller (uncredited) as The Firefighter Orange County was given 3 of 4 stars by Roger Ebert, who described it as, one of those happy projects where everything seems to fall naturally into place.

Dean s brother Eric (Matthew Bomer), who has already seen his share of combat, plans to take Dean to enlist in his beloved Marine Corps in hopes of keeping an eye on him rather than letting him take his chances at the local induction center. But Dean s plans do not coincide with his older brother s. Instead, he plans to confront Eric about dodging the draft after the boys and their respective girlfriends, Bailey (Diora Baird) and Chrissie (Jordana Brewster) head across Texas for a final fling of serious fun. Soon after their journey begins, the spirited foursome are spooked by a menacing pair of bikers, Holden (Lee Tergesen) and his girlfriend, Alex (Cyia Batten).
Hoyt finds Dean s burnt draft card and demands to know who it belongs to. To save his brother, Eric claims that it s his. After making them put Alex s body in his car, Hoyt forces the group in as well, and calls for Uncle Monty to tow the wreckage, which Chrissie is hiding in. Hoyt drives them to the Hewitt house and has Leatherface butcher Alex s body. He then hangs Eric and Dean up by their arms from rafters in a barn, and ties Bailey under a kitchen table inside the house.
Diora Baird as Bailey Lee Ermey as Charlie Hewitt Jr. Andrew Bryniarski as Thomas Hewitt / Leatherface Marietta Marich as Luda Mae Hewitt Terrence Evans as Monty Hewitt
For one, The Beginning doesn’t look or feel like a slasher movie. Gone are most of the frustrating horror clichés as well as the stereotypes that made up the victim roster. Remember scream queen Jessica Biel, whose celeb status, moralist attitude, and glistening bod made her the sole survivor? Well, you won’t find a single person like that here. Instead the characters are believable and sympathetic, which makes their predicament all the more gut-wrenching.
Eric has already served in Vietnam and survived, but can he and his group survive the fury of Leatherface? Leatherface s homicidal father and self-appointed law man, Sheriff Hoyt, wants them for dinner. Their sanity is tested by the extreme sadism and revolting cannibalism of the Hewitt family. Eric, Dean, Christie and Bailey witness unspeakable terrors and evil during their fight for survival.

Dynasty Warriors 9,,,,silvvy,,dwreddit030,,,,,,t2_4nkza,,,"I think the engine was great and I liked a lot of the new designs (some not so much). I wanted to play almost every character and try most of the weapons. However, I really miss getting 4th/5th weapons. This was previously always done on Hard mode, and some of the requirements really made me buckle down and learn the character/stage.

That being said, the Story Mode was awesome. Easily the best in the series in that regard, very historically accurate and overall well done. However, the cinematic nature of the Story Mode meant no Free Mode, and I didn't care for Conquest Mode. Sure, it let you play without having to sit through story a lot, but the stages were always the same thing. My favorite game in the series was SW2, and the stages felt much more varied and alive than in DW7.

Even with the negatives I've listed, I still loved the game. I'm a sucker for this series and can't wait to see what's coming. DW7 looked great and had a fantastic engine (after the horrible Renbu nonsense of 6), I just prefer the classic formula over the experimentation they did with 7. It was nice to see them trying to keep the series fresh, though, and I'm glad I bought it.

- Make sure to keep inventory space existent (Yes I ran out at some point so I sold village tickets plus a load of bone husk).
- Make the Hellbade GS (Not done yet... Hellblade Carapaces do you even exist?!)
- Get more Kelbi horns...
- Cry in a corner cause I can't play till Wednesday due to Amazon.uk being annoying. Actually since I have to enroll on Tuesay maybe that's a good thing?
-  Possible get replacement Palico's because the ones I use have be well... Outclassed.
- Explain to younger brother that Bloodbath Diablos is G-rank (He's nine and beat Tempered Deviljho much to my shock).
- Decide on if I want to go with a male hunter once I transfer data.

Gloria Victis,,,,RagnarokDel,,,,,,,,t2_6uj5l,,,"Greetings,
We are currently working on the largest update that Gloria Victis has ever seen. To make up for the waiting and somewhat reward you for your strong patience that you show we would like to present you a list of things that underwent major changes.
Of course, we have to leave out some minor and irrelevant fixes, for there were such many it would take you whole Christmas to scroll it down.

- Implemented articy access, which grants a lot faster and more flexible cooperation between most systems and the database.

- Database went through revision and reorganization, thanks to that it is now more clear and easier to manage

- Gameplay has been completely rebuilt and rewritten, for it to work better with articy access. It is the biggest part of the update which absorbed around 80% of the time spent and which, in a longer perspective will speed up the work tempo.

- Rewritten looting mobs system.

- Combat mechanics have been completely rebuilt and rewritten. Amount of statistics has significantly improved, as well as relations between them

- Guild system basics have been implemented along with GUI (Graphical User Interface) allowing to invite players, manage the guild, and of course – have fun together

- Improved hit detection system. It is now quicker and more accurate.

- Implemented dynamic object loading system, which significantly lowers RAM usage. With it, we are possible to create vast maps without being forced to use loading screens.

- Optimized models and textures to work better with the new dynamic object loading system.

- Environment’s quality has been improved.

- Current testing map has been significantly rebuilt and expanded to prepare it for future battles and sieges.

- Game code has been revised and optimized, beneficially influencing performance, which rose for about 30%, making the gameplay more smooth.

- Character’s sight range has been doubled.

- Third-person mode camera has been completely rebuilt.

- Changed on-screen display of information from “camera pointing” to interactive objects, e.g. resources, chests, mobs, etc.

- All animations have been completely replaced with new ones that are based on motion capture technology.

- Significantly rebuilt character controller, adapting it to the new animations. Character movement is now more smooth and natural. However, because of the controller’s complexity, it requires some improvement.

- All dialogues have been completely replaced, making them more suitable to the new storyline.

- Added new equipment elements, adapting it to the “beginnings” of a heraldry system in the game.

- Minimap system has been added.

- Registration system in-game has been improved.

- Game updating system has been improved.

- Added dynamic navigation routes and improved the old ones. Now, enemies should not block their movement and will be able to use movable objects.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1389669868.0,1389644668,,,0.0,,ceool2p,,,t3_1v4r4z,,,t3_1v4r4z,,,1,False,,,gloriavictis,t5_2yymv,,,,,,,1328482646.0,1.0,1431927048.0,13.0,,,,,,,,

Gloria Victis,,,,RagnarokDel,,,,,,,,t2_6uj5l,,,"Greetings, dear users!

In the latest news we gave you a quick look at what are we currently working on. This time we’ll focus on what we’ve got in store for you in the newest update. It’s nearly done and we all hope to see it in your hands as soon as possible!
[Image: GVUpdate.jpg]
At this moment, we are polishing new parts of Stoneholm – soon enough the available area will nearly double in size, giving you more places to discover and explore. It also signs the coming of the so-highly-anticipated division of nations, which – until now – both had their starting location in the well-known village of Mereley. The village will soon be full of stern and tough Ismirs from Styrborg and Midlanders are going to pick up a desperate fight to defend the walls of Dunfen.

These are only foundations for future conflicts between nations. Right now you will be available to explore and fight for dominance over field between Mereley and Dunfen. We are planning on implementing the basics of combat over territorial control. In the meantime, to control a territory one has to capture and hold a standard, which is located on the field.

Our goal is to make the territorial system one of the main gameplay aspects in Gloria Victis. Therefore we are developing it step by step, putting much effort into it. In the next updates you will be able to gain resources and small strategic points, which makes the control over a territory beneficial to the whole nation.

As the work progresses, the system will be added new elements and features that will be constantly implemented into the game. In the future, it will let you build fortifications or siege machines as well as allow you to plunder and destroy whole towns.

In addition to the main course, which is the territorial system, in the upcoming update we will bring jumping back as well. It now has new animations and many improvements – what would be a jump without a painful fall? Jumping off of high ledges will result in damage taken, which will depend on character statistics and currently worn equipment.

At the same time we are implementing improved combat mechanics crafting system. Unfortunately, these are very large and complex systems, thus we cannot promise that you’ll find it in the upcoming update.

And by the way, we would like to warmly thank you for your support, which made us come back to the Top Voted Games list at http://www.mmorpg.com. Currently we are holding the third place and we are treading on the first place holder’s heels.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1393904798.0,1393879598,,,0.0,,cfthjer,,,t3_1zgq2x,,,t3_1zgq2x,,,2,False,,,gloriavictis,t5_2yymv,,,,,,,1328482646.0,1.0,1432642352.0,14.0,,,,,,,,

I suspect it was only marked beta by steam's system because earlier today the game had not technically launched. Emails with our keys went out around 6 am in Bellevue WA, but the steam store doesn't update until noon Bellevue WA time. So if you activated your key sometime in those six hours before the game launched then steam thinks ""oh this game isn't out yet, this key must be for beta access.""

The Idolmaster: Starlit Season,,,,sarukada,,,,,,,,t2_5ufml,,,"Hah, well, in my books, there isn't exactly a lot of competition. The voice actresses for most of the other characters come off as too childlike (e.g. Mami/Ami, Yayoi), too husky (Makoto), too... icky (Iori), et cetera. I understand it's a necessity given the supposed ages of some of the girls and the stereotypical roles each have to fulfill, but that ends up shoehorning most of them into certain types of songs. For example, Iori's voice works well in stuff like smoky thrill, but it ruins the slower pieces like my song.

Chihaya's voice actress's singing background really stands out, and her vocals are excellent given that idolmaster is, at heart, a video game series *about* musical production, and not an actual musical production. I'm sure the VAs for the rest of the girls are just as talented, but as they're working under the restriction of having to 'sing in character', so to speak, they just don't get the chance to shine.

Other than Chihaya, I would say that Yukiho's not bad either. Then again, I'm at least somewhat biased because I generally prefer slower and calmer pieces to the more energetic and fast-paced ones, but smoky thrill's on my playlist now, so go figure.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1323474595.0,1323449395,,,0.0,,c36lip2,,,t3_n2rs8,,,t1_c36l7j3,,,1,False,,,idolmaster,t5_2t4t4,,,,,,,1315848220.0,3.0,1427996120.0,1960.0,,,,,,,,

I read on the Steam forums that the full release will have more tooltips and descriptions added which I imagine will be helpful to a lot of people. Some of the things I noticed or found odd during the 1½ demo playthroughs I did:

* The jobs (blacksmith/alchemist/thief/et cetera) should be accessible right from the start in my opinion. You unlock them by interacting with a station that requires the job, something that happens like 5 minutes into the game. Discovering new jobs is fine if they are exotic or some niche specialisation, but I think it will become tedious in the long run to be forced to make a trek to the nearest village every time you start a new playthrough just so you can unlock basic jobs like blacksmithing and thievery.
* In a similar vein to the above I'm not sure how much I like having to unlock the ability to run on the overworld map. I get that it's an upgrade, but to me it feels like it's basically just a mandatory first upgrade. 
* Having to station a tinker at a campsite's crafting station by dragging the character to it feels like unnecessary clicking since you'll also have to drag the same character back to the campfire afterwards. I think it'd be better if you just clicked on the crafting station and an interface asked which character you wanted to use for it (without moving the selected character) similarly to how you select a character for other activities such as smithing, lockpicking and so on",,,,,,,,,,1624037323.0,1624012123,,,,{},h270qil,,False,t3_o2lbzj,False,False,t3_o2lbzj,/r/WarTalesGame/comments/o2lbzj/wartales_demo_first_impressions/h270qil/,,8,,True,False,WarTalesGame,t5_4lmm40,,,,0.0,[],,,,1624336646.0,,,,[],,,,,

Playing with historical settings on, and currently in 1542 on the first scenario.

I attacked Matsudaira on the east, but he has one fortress left, where all his officers are hiding, and he's protected by Imagawa clan, and I don't want to attack them yet through the corridor south east.

I conquered the clan to the north instead, and am planning to expand from there to the mountains on the east.

The Ravagers have been spotted and are accompanied by giant creatures in their return to our planet, Earth Defense Force® 2025 arrives in 2013 for Xbox 360® and PlayStation®3 system

CITIZENS OF EARTH – DO NOT IGNORE THIS MESSAGE!

PLANET EARTH – June 28, 2025 – In 2017, an epic battle took place between humans and dangerous insect alien invaders determined to destroy our way of life. Humanity persevered during the war and destroyed the alien Mothership, recovering most of the prosperity it once had. In preparation for another insect onslaught, the mighty Earth Defense Force (EDF) devoted years of research to combat this menace by upgrading their soldier classes, artillery capabilities, vehicles and much more. However, news poured in today, that what humanity feared the most became true. The giant creatures seen in Arizona seven years ago have returned.

The EDF is calling all the citizens of Earth to join together in the fight to battle against the massive upcoming attack in 2013 for the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft and PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system. Ask yourself: are you ready to save Earth?!",,,,,,,,0.0,,1355452758.0,1355427558,,,0.0,,c7g2yqv,,,t3_14stf5,,,t3_14stf5,,,4,False,,,EDF,t5_2sm2c,,,,,,,1275671950.0,1.0,1430665080.0,179.0,,,,,,,,

The Ravagers have been spotted and are accompanied by giant creatures in their return to our planet, Earth Defense Force® 2025 arrives in 2013 for Xbox 360® and PlayStation®3 system

CITIZENS OF EARTH – DO NOT IGNORE THIS MESSAGE!

PLANET EARTH – June 28, 2025 – In 2017, an epic battle took place between humans and dangerous insect alien invaders determined to destroy our way of life. Humanity persevered during the war and destroyed the alien Mothership, recovering most of the prosperity it once had. In preparation for another insect onslaught, the mighty Earth Defense Force (EDF) devoted years of research to combat this menace by upgrading their soldier classes, artillery capabilities, vehicles and much more. However, news poured in today, that what humanity feared the most became true. The giant creatures seen in Arizona seven years ago have returned.

The EDF is calling all the citizens of Earth to join together in the fight to battle against the massive upcoming attack in 2013 for the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft and PlayStation®3 computer entertainment system. Ask yourself: are you ready to save Earth?!",,,,,,,,0.0,,1355452758.0,1355427558,,,0.0,,c7g2yqv,,,t3_14stf5,,,t3_14stf5,,,4,False,,,EDF,t5_2sm2c,,,,,,,1275671950.0,1.0,1430665080.0,179.0,,,,,,,,

The second one fixed some gameplay frustrations but also added some (stupid frickin gorilla).  The characters were a lot more generic. I really hated how unintuitive the escape routes were. You have to show up at a specific remote location at a specific time of day to trigger some of them, and how are you supposed to do that without looking it up? The survival aspect was very easy once you figure out the best way to farm food.

The third one added more unique characters but just felt like they added too much busyness. You had to micromanage so much, and really strain a lot to get to some of the basic advances. It added a lot more story, but, I don't know, I just didn't find it really engaging. And one of the characters just constantly grated on my nerves. XD

I'm actually replaying the game again for 3 days since last year. I've got short-term memory loss, so it helps me enjoy games again and again. I'll remember details more and more as I play them (Armored Core for PSOne I've got memorized as easily as my name lol).

I've beaten LiB1 3 times and I love it. LiB2 I've played some, but that high-pitched ""Oh?"" from the girl character grates on my nerves every time I talk to her. LiB3 didn't draw me in as much with its, as I call it, ""budget anime"" graphics.

LiB2 seems interesting enough, so after I beat the first one again, I'll check it out more. Prolly won't play LiB3 in all honesty.

As far as your fur goes, unless you've used it for a spoiler (in which you only need 2), you can trash the rest. It's not needed for anything.

Fishing is easily done with the rod in comparison to the spear. The spear seems to have a 'juke-range' so it tends to be inaccurate. Of course, if you fish a lot, you might wind up catching a lot of bait fish. If you're desperate for food, keep them. If you're well off, toss them and keep bass/bigger fish.

Depending on how far you are in the game I could discuss more. Feel free to DM me, as I have quite a liking to this game and I'm looking into making a PC/Linux alternative to it in the near future. Heck, I'm on modeling the fruit you can pick up.",,,,,,,,,,1588749610.0,1588724410,,,,{},fpm2tds,,False,t3_gapxhk,False,True,t3_gapxhk,/r/LostInBlue/comments/gapxhk/i_love_lost_in_blue/fpm2tds/,,1,,True,False,LostInBlue,t5_39h5j,,,,0.0,[],,,,1588729947.0,,,,[],,,,,

I liked the fishing rod enough in LiB1 but the one in LiB2 is useless imo. 
Catching small animals with a bow/arrow is nearly impossible, try small traps. Hunting in general is pretty difficult in that game, I usually only did it if I needed fat, fur or feathers. I don't remember the fur being used for anything important except improving the bed. 

As for Skye, don't forget that Keith is the dumb bitch that stepped on her glasses.

But BOTW has the same ingredient hunting, gathering, boosts in foraged items, etc. It feel s a bit isolated because you're mostly alone, and there are lots of secrets to discover. The puzzles are fun, too.

I also like the way it doesn't rely on *fear*, like a lot of modern survival games seem to. I think the fear you feel in Lost in Blue is a byproduct of the gameplay...the gameplay doesn't *revolve* around you feeling scared. (Which personally puts me off a lot of other survival games.)

Lost in Blue: Shipwrecked,[],,,kidkipp,,,[],,,,text,t2_k5csqhr,False,False,"there’s a river directly to the right of the cave. go down a bit and you’ll see a spot covered in pebbles by the water. you can drink from it there! then on the beach you can sometimes find empty jugs that you can start filling up with water to have throughout the day. 

a tip about running: don’t continuously run. if you just run in short spurts you save a ton of energy. like one second on, one second off or something. 

make a spear for fishing as soon as possible and then you’ll stop relying on coconuts. 

i could never beat this game when i was a kid but one other thing that is a literal game-changer: mushrooms! they grow right by the cave to the left (along with a few other areas) and come in many different colors. one color will poison you, most will feed you a bit, but one—after an hour or so of eating it—will make it so that your energy doesn’t deplete for a while! it’s a good idea to try and figure out which one that is early on. also, every time you reset the game so does the affect of the mushrooms. so it might be orange on this save file but white on the next.

edit: a good spot for firewood and a stick for a spear are directly to the right of your cave. between it and a river you should see a ledge you can climb up. there are a few trees that drop twigs and logs there.

another tip: find your partner early. she’s across the river and will allow you to cook! also, periodically search the grass for seasoning and bait (i want to say the button is A but i might be wrong)

And also something minor: I was told that this was a visual novel when I first found it, but I wouldn't call it that from what i've seen (not that i'm complaining). I noticed some sounds when I chose some dialogue options when first meeting Skye. Do any of these interactions lead up to something?

X Rebirth,,,,SevyRes,,xr,,,,,,,,,"The problem with the older games is that they were never optimized for more than a single core. They also have the issue that every time something you own occupies space in a system, the game has to calculate everything going on within that system. Having a huge spread of ships, factories and satellites across many systems leads to making it that much more demanding of what little resources are available. You would quickly run out of processing power and available memory. Using something like SETA just compounded issues further.

With XRebirth, it's finally giving us the ability to use multi-core CPUs to their potential. From what I've seen and heard, there is also no longer any collision detection, which means that the game can slack off a bit with AI in systems you are not actively playing in. If the earlier games tried doing this, you'd be losing ships pretty darn quick.

I'm assuming that they've made some further tweaks to how your AI ships behave when you are not nearby to optimize performance. If we don't have the view monitors anymore (the ones that you could follow other ships with that docked on the left and right of your screen), that makes things a bit easier for the game as well in saving resources.

There is a video I saw of a guy running an i5 2500k + GTX 670 + 8gb RAM @ 1080p that said he didn't have any issues aside from the occasional bump in frame rate with the Gamescom demo. The final game will be more polished, and tweaks and updates are bound to boost performance after release.

Short answer is that I think you'll be fine. I don't expect I'll have a problem with my rig (i7 3770k, GTX 770, 32gb RAM (1600mhz) @ 1080p). Your GPU is definitely better, and the CPU is more or less comparable. The additional memory in my rig is more of a ""why not"" feature, but it's to help future-proof my system for a while longer.

X3TC and X3AP will still run a bit sluggish at times with that setup simply because of the hardware limitations of the engine.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1384211629.0,1384186429,,,0.0,,cdbsfko,,,t3_1qdgm4,,,t3_1qdgm4,,,4,False,,,XRebirth,t5_2si8z,,,,,,,,1.0,1428703993.0,11123.0,,,,1384186795.0,,,,

3) I'm new to the game too, as far As i can tell it is all dependent on how you build your decks. I was wasting BC early on as well until I read a bit more on deck structuring. To simplify things you want to make sure there is always at least one healer in any given attack row. This will sustain your deck in harder engagements and allow you to dish out more damage or kill the higher lvl adversaries. It takes a bit of playing around, but the annoying thing is, is everything is really theory crafting as testing it can sometimes be costly and waste BC. 

The main wiki is about a year ahead of us in content, but still has useful info on things. Use this combo list for a better idea on ways to build your deck. But other then that make sure you got atleast one healer in every row.

http://million-arthur.wikia.com/wiki/Card_Combo

Side note: Sometimes once you get stronger cards, it might be better to build single row atk decks, this minimizes the amount of BC you use so you don't blow everything in one atk, and allows you to atk multiple times, but again you'll have to lvl up and strengthen your cards to a point to where that is viable.",,,,,,,,0.0,,1437122151.0,1437096951,,,0.0,,ct62wjm,,,t3_3dkoqb,,,t3_3dkoqb,,,1,False,,,millionarthur,t5_313um,,,,,,,1325277909.0,1.0,1437921114.0,705.0,,,,,,,,

Billion Road,[],,,nonuscinaedus,,,[],,,,text,t2_65ipynag,False,False,"I've beaten Billion King in two ways. 

First strategy, get a Hogger and a Sticky/Rich Ring (or Summoning Whistle), hope he drops his Shieldon before he invests too much, then warp to him and take half his money (can also be done with Money Ninja and Zhats Rich earlier in the game to build up funds). You can repeat this once or twice more, but then make sure you invest with that money quickly, you don't want to lose it. I've beaten him with this but it's not entirely reliable.

Second strategy, and what I've found more successful, is to get up a goal streak during the Money Ninja-Zhats Rich 5-year period. If you can get a streak of 10+ in a row the money bonus is insane, and the bonus items (mainly the Ultra 4 Dice) will basically guarantee you get the next goal. Extremely beneficial cycle. Best monster combo is probably Speedy/Shieldon/the Viking offensive monster (Speedy's ability extends to item dice so with an Ultima 5 you can roll 5 dice then 5 again), or swap Shieldon for Exactorn and pick up Shieldon before Billion King comes. Once he comes ignore the goals for the most part, try to get one every few goals so he doesn't build up much of a streak, re-invest for 3-tier monopolies, and just carry a few Follower Bazookas for security.

Playstation store updates on Tuesdays and generally games release on Tuesdays as well, and that's when it'll likely hit due to being a digital F2P game. That narrows it down to Nov 28th or Dec 6th, 13th, or 20th. 

Personally I don't think it'll release in the week after Christmas and before New years, it's a weird time and in a recent interview it was mentioned you can ""count the weeks"".

28th is the same release date as FF15, which could potentially rule out that day, but you never know.

I would personally assume December 6th or 13th, it could be earlier but that leaves some time for more news to come out about it without it being a surprise release and not just before christmas.",,,,,,,,0,,1480230532.0,1480205332,,,0,,dagxrdh,,,t3_5dhejs,,,t3_5dhejs,,,1,,,False,LetItDie,t5_324h4,,,,,,,1314848558.0,1.0,1481776049.0,798048.0,,,,,,,,
